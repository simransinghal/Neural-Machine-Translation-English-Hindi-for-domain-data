the roots of mangrove are situated at some height from the surface so that they can receive the necessary amount of oxygen from air
several small aquatic creatures are generated in the roots of the mangroves
the leaves of mangroves are the food of several small creatures living in water
even birds flying in the heights of sky depend on these very mangroves for their food
this is the reason that these grasslands situated in the sea are called the source of life also
to be the view of this extraordinary world of the sea life one has to get the permission from the office of national marine park located in jamnagar then starts journey which reveals several mysteries of sea life
just as we reached the bedi port our sights fell on big group of birds and dolphins hopping on the surface of water also was seen
we started our travel from the bedi port
just as we reached the port our eyes fell on large group of birds which became invisible from eyes touching the shore in seconds
we had not yet covered even few minutes of our journey as luck gave us company and we saw dolphins hopping on the surface of water
seeing these dolphins playing in water it was appearing as if they were welcoming our arrival to this island
as we were reaching near the island mangrove forest and bevy of different kinds of birds sitting on its branches were getting clearer to our eyes
preying birds like hover and marsh herrier were flying at some height above the level of water with their focussed eyes and sharp claws
as soon as it saw prey it pounced with the electrical agility on them and got hold of them in its sharp claws
here we also got to see bevy of rare birds like pallas fish also
from far off the light house of pirotan island was visible to us
in about two hours we covered this journey filled with adventure
wearing cover of the golden sand on the shores of this island innummerable crabs crawling on the ground will come to your sight
to see and undersatand the natural diversity of pirotan island it is imperative to have guide
the nearest airport of pirotan island is at distance of seven kilometers in jamnagar
the nearest railway station of pirotan island is jamnagar and rajkot at distance of kms
the best time for going to pirotan is between october to april
as if standstill came in the surface of the sea that is the situation of low tide was created
with the guide of the forest department sheelu bhai we went out to see the unique scene of life in water
here in the clean water we got to see so many ranges of rocks of coral
seeing these rocks it was appearing as if it was treasure of preciuos stones
in reality these dazziling ranges of rocks play the role of security shield to microorganism with the decreasing level of water and the effect of light this range turn more beautiful and colorful
the first sea creature on which our sights fell was octopus
perhaps it had got feeling of the fact that we had seen it and like lizard it adapted itself in the color of the stone
for the first time we were seeing any sea creature so closely
on the surface of its body there were several small pores
through which it tightens its prey strongly in its hold
the speciality of this illusory creature is that it can adapt itself into different color according to the environment
as soon as sheelu bhai freed it it emitted liquid substance of black color into water and disappeared like smoke
there are many such creatures in the sea that use their unique abilities either to hunt or to protect themselves from getting hunted
star fish can separate its arms from its body as soon as it comes in the clutches of the hunter
fish named puffer can even enlagre its body three times bigger that its real size
seeing it any one can get hallucinated that it is powerful big fish
it was thrilling view to see different races of crabs present here
apart from blue neptune red coral the upper part of the body of some was covered with thorny hair which sheelu bhai gave the name of wolf crab
just in while our meeting with star fish and puffer fish also occurred
as soon as sheelu bhai picked up the puffer fish in his hands it bloated like balloon
it is really workable mechanism for protection
one more interesting fact about this fish is that puffer is one among those fish which can blink its eyelids
different type of octopus jelly fish red coral which looks very attractive
with the kingfisher many alluring and unique birds are visible in the port which keep the environment resonant
to see these creatures living in the water you may have to get down two to three feet into water
therefore tourists should keep special care for this fact that they wear such shoes which can keep them protected from the poisonous creatures living in water
in the clean water of the sea groups of colorful sea lily and sea pen enchanted us
looking like garden in reality this beautiful view is not of any flora but of group of sea creatures
which while attracting fish and other small creatures towards themselves make them their prey
as the day started to pass by we came back to the island
far from the life of town filled with hubbub and hurly burly there is also shrine where local people came sometimes and performed namaz
there is neither proper arrangement for food nor for drinking water on this island therefore before coming here tourists should make proper arrangements for drinking water and food
generally all the tourists return back by the evening but we decided to spend the night here and we got permission too
when the redness of the setting sun behind the horizon fall on this island then its natural beauty gets enhances four folds
in the darkness of the night in this peaceful island only squeals of the waves are heard
while returning from the island we saw kingfisher on the mangrove
looking at large group of sea crows it was appearing as if they were following us
when we got up due to chirping of birds then the scene here was really spellbinding
seeing the birds flying in the sky it was appearing as if they were drawing different shapes
if you were lucky you would see mammal creature looking like seal named dugong which is on the last brink of extinction today
as there started stir in the sea water we understood that the level of water is rising
the phenomenon of the rise of sea water is called high tide
in high tide the level of water comes to such height that the boat can float easily
now we decided to bid adieu to this island
the sea has god knows how many mysteries wrapped in its lap to become facetoface with which pirotan island is appropriate
located at distance of kilometres from bedi port pirotan island is famous for sea creatures along with its unique natural beauty

near the vaan lrb meters rrb forest rest house in the park we fixed our tent
by three light drizzle began and we were forced to go inside the tents
at dawn we went in an ancient temple nearby
our difficult journey was to begin from today in the right aspect
first the climb was light after that levelled field came
here in one direction various kinds of flowers were scattered and some local people instructed us to go ahead fast
our goal of today bedni bugyal is right now very far
now there was approximately descent of two kilometers after that crossing mountainous river via bridge we entered dense jungles
now there was continuous ascent our breath would shorten on walking some distance only
taking deep breaths making our breath regular we were going forward
the climb and the jungle both were just not coming to an end
slowly the jungle ended and we were in bugyal lrb an open field of grass rrb
bedani region had already started but our camp was in bedani basin lrb meter rrb which was still one and half kilometers away
all around fog had descended
walking slowly we reached bedani kund and set our tents in the field near to it
on the clearing of the evening weather we obtained the rare sight of peaks like trishul nandaghunti chaukhamba
one had to just see to believe the shadow of trishul in bedani hollow
with the intention of getting ourselves accustomed for the upcoming journey instead of going in the direction of rupkund the next day we made the program of going to the nearby aali bugyal
the beauty of aali bugyal was worthseeing carpet of green grass spread far on that scattered yellow flowers and sheepgoats and horses roaming free
our evening was spent in the camp of bedani hollow
early morning the minute it was seven we started our journey
trees had left our company since long now only few plants could be seen on the grass
on route we could see three potholes our guide told that the name of this place is pathar nachodi
it is said that three apsarahs had been sent to break the ascetic practice of some hermit
on the ascetic practice being broken the hermit overpowered by anger turned the fairies to stone
but in the stone form also the dance of those fairies continued so the hermit buried them in the potholes
the opinion of local people was this but the opinion of some people is this that these potholes might have been produced due to the falling of lightening
now there was the challenging sharp climb we were at height of more than feet each step was becoming heavy
approximately after walking three kilometers it started snowing carefully stepping on the snow all reached rupkhand by half past seven
ice was frozen on the lake and little away from there we also found human remains
everyone eyes were moist success was not felt yet
gradually everyone began to believe that ultimately we have reached rupkhund
then what the skies revererated with victory cries of shiva ji and nanda devi
ahead there was small temple of nanda devi ji everyone bowed heads respectfully and distributed offerings of rasagullas
everyone was eager to capture this unique scene in their cameras
they were reminded that the journey has not yet ended instead scaling more height now had to reach shila samudra via jorawar lane
ahead there was only snow but everyone courage was high
the guide and his comapnions started making path by cutting ice with an ice axe
crossing the feet height now we were at the edge of joravar lane
the weather was clear ahead were the skyscraping peaks of mrigthuni trishul and nandaghunti
after watching these rare sights from this height of feet for sometime we started descending the other side with the help of rope
after crossing the snow only stones could be seen this was shilasamudra
on one side of us was mrigathuni the other side was trishul and on the third side nandaghunti peaks and we had just come from the fourth rupkhand
shilasamudra is bottomless sea of stones
on the road from shilasamudra to homkund there are only stones
there was need for great caution on the road from shilasamudra to homkund
each footstep had to be kept fixedly from some distance we found nandakini river coming from nandaghunti glacier
we were advancing forward finding path among stones with care in the direction of the left bank of nandakini
evening four oclock we reached near two large rocks it is called dodang this only was our night camp
our goal was yet two kilometers away from homkund
dodang place was in the asolute middle of nandaghunti and trishul peaks and where the two peaks meet that is called ronti central
there was severe winter in dodang by six oclock the waters of the close flowing sarita froze
just then we got sight of rare animal bharal because of the false knowledge of there not being any danger from us these mountain goats looking like deer with their families began playing near us

tsomoriri lake piece of the blue sky on the ground
at distance of kilometer from leh included in the protected area situated in the midst of extensive mountain ranges and the roost of diversified birds at one end of the world the beauty of tsomoriri lake is unique
am talking of the tsomoriri lake which is probably situated at one end of the world
the calm deep blue color of the water of tsomoriri lake makes this appear as if piece of blue sky has come falling on the earth
situated at height of approximately feet from the earth the tsomoriri lake is kilometer long and from eight to ten kilometer wide
the mountains on four sides of tsomoriri lake are always covered with snow
situated in the rupshu valley of ladakh the extremely beautiful tsomoriri lake is the breeding place for many kinds of birds
from june till september months specific kinds of swans high crested birds and brahmani ducks can be seen swimming in large numbers
the sweet water of tsomoriri lake is an invaluable gift of many migratory birds
after crossing distance of kilometers from leh we had reached tsomoriri in the month of september
in ladakhi language the meaning of tso is lake
for coming till tsomoriri lake we had to cross leh upsi chumathang mahe and piga
in the middle falls nam sangla valley whose height is approximztely feet
approximately kilometers ahead from here is small canal on crossing the bridge constructed on which moriri lake begins
outside strong freezing winds are blowing
it is not possible to stand till much time in the strong freezing winds and be able to take the pleasure of the beauty of the lake
according to dorjee lrb driver rrb we were going to karzok the village at the border
for going to karzok the road runs along the edge of the lake
after going five kilometers ahead from the road at the edge of the lake karzok village comes
karzok village is the permanent residence place of an aborigines changpa
sustaining the bad weather of karzok the changpa people do farming of barley here
it is believed that farming of barley in the highest area of the world is done in karzok
changpa rear yak sheep and goat and live all year in tents made of the black colored fur of the yak
pashmina goats are valuable assets of the changpa people
in days of winter thick hair grows on pashmina goats
in days of summer the changpa people make an accumulation of the hair shed by the pashmina goats
the hair shed by the pashmina goats is called pashm
the famous pashmina shawls of kasmir are made from pashm only
we had become tired by continuously doing mountain trekking for six hours
we were also feeling very hungry
on reaching karzok having eaten hot khichdi at small restaurant made in parachute tent the hunger subsided
when we stretched our arms and legs sometime in the warmth of the bed laid in the tent then we felt alive and the desire to do something awakened
we went to see the only gompa lrb budhha temple rrb of the village situated in the vicinity
the entrance door of the main temple of the gompa lrb budhha temple rrb is very colorful and pictorial
having climbed the roof of the inclusion room of the gompa saw tsomoriri ourselves
the heart lifted up on having seen fascinating flock of birds of tsomoriri with binoculars
from the roof of the gompa tried to see the tents of the changpa aborigines but could not see
maybe on going more ahead from here viewing would have happened
the map of karzok is changing with the new buildings constructed of concrete according to the usage of the cities
its obvious that in this way there can be infiltration unknowingly in the natural beauty and tradition of the village
seeing this from the roof of gompa wished that if there remained fixed traditional culture here instead of modern culture then such unique view would have been seen
tsomoriri situated in rupshu valley is cultural area
therefore for entering in tsomoriri travellers require permission letter
on requesting this permission letter can be obtained free from the deputy collector office situated near of the polo ground of leh
the permission letter is obained for minimum four persons and maximum for one week
travellers are given advice that make many photo copies of the permission letter because this is asked at many check posts
consume adequate water during journey
the way of water consumption compensates less oxygen in the environment

here at barrier of the forest department the checking of our permit was done and the fixed tax for tourists and car was recovered from us and our entry was made in register
the path from here to binsar was very narrow and we were having to drive the car with great care
on route we could also see famous ancient temples
the road otherwise was of kilometers only but due to the road being narrow to reach binsar it had taken us approximately three quarter of an hour
at the very first we saw the rest house of kumaon mandal vikas nigam in whose courtyard windmill and the mountain peaks of the himalays behind were perceptible
the rest house here is truly an imposing building
there are two rooms in this rest house of white color
the bedroom and sitting rooms were quite big and old style furniture had been put here with great order

here our meeting happened with young man named pradeep who was going to take us to the highest place in binsar zero point in the morning
the next morning it was very cold
we were walking fast for zero point because we wanted to see the sight of the first rays of the sun falling on the frozen white peaks of the himalayas
one advantage of coming here in the month of november was this that the sky was absolutely clear
ahead the peaks of the himalayas were touching the sky with pride
pradeep told us the names of some of the peaks from these like chowkhamba nanda devi nandakoti and panch chuli
one by one the white colored peaks began to turn gold and soon everything became golden
we all began to capture this unique natural sight in our cameras
after the sun rose more the peak became white again and soon fog also descended
after walking for about one and half kilometers we reached the temples
because of being in less populated protected area here both flora and fauna were flourishing

but pathiramnal is for those people who can not bear expenditures of lakhs but want to take pleasure
yes surrounded by water from four sides in the own country of god this is heaven on earth
you can reach pathiramanal by air route from any place of the world
you will disembark very close of this island
the nearest at kilometres is cochin international airport
pathiramanal is also linked by rail route
the names of the nearest railway stations are alapuzha and kottayam
both these stations are at distance of kilometres
after disembarking in zurich walked towards beautiful and cosmopolitan city geneva
this on common basis gives birth to the confusion of switzerland being the capital but is not
maybe the reason of this is that the whole world like the headquarters of united nations the world health organization red cross and international labor organization etc is there
all these especially the united nations are places worth visiting
the best thing is this that you can roam most places walking and the rest one or two places by bus
then it was said that should definitely see an important archaeological place cathedral saint pierre
if these type of things do not attract you much then you can also leave it
but if you like places like these then you can spend your some time there
later went to red cross and red crescent museum
here the human atrocities happening in the recent history has been documented in the form of films statues and sound tracks
but the thing about geneva liked the most and is also maybe the favorite of the tourists
that is walking along geneva lake and admiring jet deau
one such big fountain lrb and the largest in europe also rrb which throws water down from metres high in the air
the favorite work of the tourists is to keep standing there so some drops of water spread by gusts of wind touch their face with love
for this place you will not need any directions because this is seen from anywhere in the whole city
from my experience can say this that less expensive hotels are in reality not less expensive
the best alternative is youth hostel where the expenditure of one night comes near of dollars
after deciding the place of staying roaming is most expensive
the better alternative is this that take travel pass
in switzerland there are many types of passes available which are the best for you choose that
now also this is right that take rail pass journey of bus and boat remain included in this
the price of pass of one day is dollars
this is not some bad alternative because after this you can also undertake journey anywhere in switzerland
although geneva is not cheap place but nothing is cheap in switzerland
despite this spent only dollars everyday
on reaching there once you will feel that the most expenditure in switzerland happens on journey and food not necessarily in this order
even then reduction can be done in large measures in these
because the true beauty of switzerland is not in miracles made by humans rather in the raw colors of nature

most people coming to paris like to see the eiffel tower first
this was not our first stage but then not the last as well
in the dark night sitting on bench we kept admiring the eiffel tower for some time
our some friends went on the eiffel tower also taking tickets of twelve euros
it was not that there was less money with us and for that reason we did not go up
we had got to know that sight like that from eiffel tower can be also be had free

anoushka shankar told spriha srivastava about the harmonious and beautiful evenings spent in kopanang and goa
for enjoying holidays where do you like to go
without losing any moments would like to take the name of goa
like to go frequently to goa and spend the best holidays in less money
but kopanang of thailand is that lone place the holidays spent where can never forget
had gone there on holiday of one week with few friends of england
there are not any telephones there
there you will not get any modern comforts like this
so when we reached there we had no reservations etc
there you will get tree house made on trees
you can stay on its platform climbing on the trees
there is bathroom there containing flowing water
but whatever other things are there that can only be called basic
the area adjoining the shore of the sea is wild
there the cost of spending one night is just thai baht
apart from this there is nothing as such on which an amount can be spent
this is why you can call my this holiday budget holiday in the right meaning
any special thing of this place that can not be forgotten even deliberately
memories of kopanang are heart touching ones
this place is known for events happening on nights of full moon
there is no proper road there
only an island is there
for going from one island to another island there the only one support is the fish catching boat
this is why when you get off on another island from one island there then you suddenly find yourself on deserted place
this in itself feels quite attractive
we had set camp on just some distance from this place
where happens the organization of full moon night parties
did you participate in any such party organized there
like being included in such parties
but by bad luck was not at that place then when the organization of that party happened
as such this much is fixed that whenever go on holiday then harbor desire of complete peace and rest
any special place of attraction for travellers there
there is one more place whose name is century spa resort
this is at distance of two shores from that place on which shore tree houses are built
there is small resort there
classes of yoga are run over there
used to go there every morning taking walk in the direction of the mountains
there used to do yoga practice till few hours and after that used to return
this was the most peaceful moment of the holidays
tell about some more memorable moments which will always dwell in your heart and mind
there was my room partner vicky
she is my friend and lives in london
she and used to every morning at half past three get awakened on hearing the unknown sound of some big animal
every night our condition remained bad with fear
one night we remained awake to see which animal is that after all
that was basically big lizard found in thailand
that was almost one feet long and was in our bathroom
it was like our third room partner in our whole stay there
in some days we got used towards its coming in the room hanging on walls and slithering on tooth brush
you had also mentioned goa is this also your favorite destination of spending holidays
yes goa for me is place like that where enjoy going again and again
in less expense only holidays can be spent there
for me this is also important in this meaning that this is in our country
enjoy going there every year
but few years back what used to be the character of goa that place has not remained very safe now
in many matters the desire harbor to spend such informal holidays with safety that does not seem possible there
now more than enjoyment go there with mission of living peaceful life
for newlywed couples who want to go for celebrating honeymoon will give them advice to go to kopanang
for celebrating honeymoon this place is also good because here happens more romantic experience
as far as it is matter of goa then in reality should think of going for getting enjoyment with friends there

hindi and gujarati are heard in every streets of nairobi and indian sari lahanga etc are common clothes there
it is also advised to be little cautious about nairobi

in the starting days when hunters used to come to africa with the goal of hunt then the hunter who hunted these big animals were considered brave
among these big animals the most dangerous are buffaloes
when told the guide that in india people raise these buffaloes and also drink their milk then the guide informed us just then that the pet buffaloes of india are water buffaloes

the heritage of the red fort is inherent not just in the magnificent of its design or the grandeur of its buildings or the beauty of its gardens or the sound of its fountains
each of the stone each of the pillars each of the canopy painting and footpath narrate the story of the past era
all of the places of the red fort tell us how this great empire formed
how unparalleled color of grandeur were filled in the grand buildings of the red fort
how the red fort remained the witness of mercy and cruelty
how supremely powerful fort finally became the victim of its own pride inaction and illusion and how it went into the hands of an indifferent and selfish company and later the british rulers
after sad event of the english army captured the red fort
for an obstacle free communication of its soldiers and weapons the english army demolished all the buildings in hemisphere of about yards towards one side of which was the jama masjid and chandani chowk and on the other side was the wall of the red fort
despite such destructive works nearby the red fort the english rulers could not escape the glitter of its royal traditions
this very royal tradition was on its full glitter on th december when king george the fifth and his queen dressed in the shining crown and colorful clothes and along with grandeur of the kings had accepted the greetings of about five lac people from the arches of the red fort
for indian freedom fighters as well the red fort remained symbol of power
the slogan given by netaji subhash chandra bose to his indian national army was dilli chalo
pt nehru also hoisted the first flag of independent india on august
for years the red fort has borne several downs of the time
history has left the marks of its wounds on the red fort
the remaining energy of the red fort also got destroyed due to carelessness
till few months earlier with the ambience inside and outside near the red fort we understand how careless we were towards our cultural wealth
after becoming the culture and tourism minister when visited the fort for an intensive study of the red fort saw several dilapidated constructions
in the eastern direction of the red fort there was filth filled colony where there were chor bazar open urinals and obstacled sewers
in place of these now charming park has been built which is spread to the front of the rajghat from the norther tip of the red fort

wildlife tourism is well developed in america canada and countries of southern africa like kenya tanjania etc
wildlife tourism is big source of income in countries of eastern africa
thousands of tourists come to the national parks of these countries and enjoy the adventurous forest view here
tourists get full happiness of viewing the wildlife in natural condition and take their pictures
more than one crore tourists come to see the nairobi national park of kenya
tourism industry has emerged as the biggest source of earning foreign currency in india but it has been able to attract only percent of the tourists of the world
india tourism till now has been centred on the places of religious cultural historical and geographical importance
therefore foreign tourists are given the tour to pilgrimages ancient temples historical forts memorials memorials stupas or ruins art galleries museums and pleasant cities and sea shores
tourism based on wildlife has not yet got priority in india
tourists in india do not come with an approach solely towards wildlife tourism
still gradually an inclination away from historical and cultural tourism towards entertainment and aesthetics based tourism has come and in this change wild life tourism is also included
the location of the national parks forest reserves tiger reserves and other protected areas in our country is in different views residing places and climate areas
therefore they have divergence and diversity of fauna and flora in them
among the wild animals residing in these protected areas like lions tigers panthers snowpanthers elephant wild buffalo ox several species of wild sheep and goat apes monkeys squirrels crocodiles fish wild cats wild dogs bears etc along with colorful birds are natural attraction of tourists
the national parks of africa are vast and no damage occurs to them with the entrance of big number of tourists together in them
wild animals like lions of africa are tolerant towards tourists while the animals like tiger living in the national parks of india are shy and like to stay away from tourists
it is also matter of attention that the tourists of african parks are often foreigners which are disciplined and follow the rules and orders with alertness
tourists in the parks of india are generally local people who have not yet developed such behavior that are suitable to follow the rules list of the park
therefore we will have to prepare rules and regulations and codes of conduct according to our situations to run wild life tourism in our country
we need to be more alert to systematise and regularise tourists in our national parks
it has been estimated that among the tourists of the country five percent tourists tour national parks and forest reserves
in those parks of india that can be reached easily and which has achieved fame wild life tourism has increased there
among these parks kajiranga manas sundarban gir corbett sultanpur tadowa sanjay gandhi keoladeo sariska kanha bandipur madumalaya nagarhole bannerghatti periyar are prominent
latest data of tourists touring every year in all of these parks are not available
yet it has been estimated that up to in gir national park and up to tourists in kajiranga national park reach every year
about tourists visit in manas national park also
while periyar national park attract lac tourists every year
sanjay gandhi national park borivali is quite near mumbai metropolis and more than lac tourists come here
in the whole of asia this is the biggest number entering any protected wild life area
about tourists come to betla corbett and kanha national parks
the number of tourists of sultanpur keoladeo and tadowa national parks is from to every year
to tourists come to sariska bandipur sundarban bannerghatta and nagarhole national parks
the number of tourists in the madhav and bandhavgarh national parks of madhya pradesh is nearly to
very less tourists reach parks like dachigam valley of flowers namdafa indravati keibul lamjao pin valley great himalaya parks which are either distant or unreachable
however there is no about in it that the number of tourists going to these parks are constantly increasing and in future there is great possibility of wild life tourism increasing in india in future
there for the managers of these parks it is necessary that they prepare early schemes to solve the problem of constantly increasing tourists
when we talk about wild life tourism then saying this would not be irrelevant that some tourists do not lose to misuse these guest houses
showing their wealth they break the peace of the parks
they create noise by running transistor and tape recorder and musical instruments on these national parks which are forbidden in these parks
such people inspire the staff of the guest house by giving the lure of their position and wealth to ignore the discipline and rules of the park
guest houses are built in almost all of the parks in our country
so as no problem of residence occurs on reaching in the park one should reserve these guest houses before
these parks are often open for tour from morning till sunset
several parks are closed for travellers in special parts of the year like rains
different fee is decided for entrance accommodation food cameras guides passengers private vehicles etc in the parks
there is ban on carrying fire weapons inside the park
it is mandatory for tourists to follow some rules to maintain the peace and safety inside the park
tourism is mainly for entertainment
along with entertainment historical and religious tourism can also be achieved
but wild life tourism has different objective and that is evoking awareness towards the protection and conservation of environment
in this era of the deformity of the nature the message of improvement in the environment has great importance
to bring this message to the tourists parks can play certain role
tourists should take great precaution and alertness while touring in the complex of the park because any encounter of tourists and wild life due to any lapse can result in sad event
in this regard reminding the incident of the death of british birdlover on january in corbett national park in such an incident would not be irrelevant
david hunt reached such desolate place in the dhikala forest range following an owl alone where wild animal killed and ate him
in the complex of the national park travel is an important part of tourism and this should also be considered
the wild animals get disturbed with the dust generated by the speed of the vehicles inside the park and the sound of the vehicles
therefore controlling their speed and use is necessary
till now our national parks are not fully able to fulfil the demands of wildlife
in some parks the tourists cell is in the core area which is not appropriate with regard to nature protection
in several parks designated area for tourists has not been demarcated
nature interpretation centres have not been established in all the parks for the convenience and guidance of the tourists
the arrangement of stay management of traffic in the complex and photo shooting are not available in some national parks
despite shortcomings in the wild life tourism attention is definitely being paid on raising its standards in which needs of tourists are fulfilled
to develop wild life tourism under the development of national parks and sanctuaries project there should be separate arrangement of financial help for wildlife tourism

tired we were looking dreamily at the camel caravan

the desert area of syria starts from its capital damascus itself
newly developed damascus city has been beautifully adorned with greenery
damascus puts the tourists coming in into confusing state for once if they are really moving around in desert area
all around damascus are wide and clean roads
green trees flowers and grasses at the both sides of the streets and in the middle of some streets enhance the beauty of the city four folds
the trimming and pruning of all the trees planted along the street sides are done with great skill
hillocks of jabal kasyun visible from new damasucs city too can not help but attract every tourist coming here
the meaning of jabal in arabic language is mountain
the pattern of the greenery of trees growing in rows amidst the multistoried buildings built on these barren looking hills are visible from far itself
these mountains of damascus are mostly of solid rocks
the muddy colored buildings built on these mountians are mixed up with each other in such way that the difference between the mountains and the buildings can not be made out in daylight
the picture of the other side of jabal kasyun which looks barren from the front is completely different
after coming here it does not look like barren mountain at all
the mountain is completely covered with greenery
this mountain has been decorated as beautiful park here
wide roads green trees seem to be inviting every tourist to come to them
hills spreading around this look like having pattern of greenery and buildings as before
the eastern part of syria adjoining the border of iraq is desert
the soil of the eastern part of syria is not sandy but rocky unlike other desert areas
not even grass grows on this rocky soil
if we go towards palmira city situated in the northeast of damascus similar kind of barren mountains are seen spreading for miles along with the border of iraq
the most surprising thing one gets to see on these mountains is the pine trees grown in rows here and there on these mountains at some places even the trees grown in groups on these mountains are seen
it is difficult to explain in words how pleasing the trees grown like this on these barren mountains are to the environment lovers
to see such large number of trees being planted in this desert area of syria like this is also pleasant hint towards this country love for trees and protecting environment from being polluted
the job of planting trees on these barren mountains of syria is no doubt done by the government forest and irrigation department
the job of planting trees is also done by school children
there are special camps set up during school vacations
these plants are provided free of cost by forest department to the school children
children are also supposed to grow plants on some land part in syria and get clearance certificate before sitting in the board examination
only then can children sit in the board examination
later on the responsibility of taking care of these plants planted by the children is of irrigation department
these plants are given fertilizers and water from time to time
these plants are looked after as newborn babies
we happen to see groups of these trees anywhere on the barren mountains
it is not that the government department takes care of the the trees grown on the mountains only
the responsibility of taking care of the plants trees of whole of syria too is of the governmnet department
the trees along the streets are trimmed during the autumn season
so that the trees spread more and grow up in the coming season
besides pine trees one can find various types of trees like dates palm fruit trees like orange lemon fig and eucalyptus olive etc by the road side
the trimming of palm and dates trees is done properly and regularly with the help of cranes
the people of syria love these trees so much that anybody can not even think of illegally cutting them down knowingly or unknowingly
if someone still commits this type of mistake he may have to face severe punishment
the wilted trees are cut down and new plants planted immediately at that place by department employees
every environment lover toursist coming to syria can not help getting surprised to see these manmade forests on barren land
it was not even dawn when the train dropped us off in the deserted silence of sicily oceanic and hill station taormina giardini station and drove off
only one passenger had alighted from the train and he too got lost somewhere in that darkness at the wink of an eye
there was no sign of the ticket checker either
when came out on the street with my daughter sharada the same stark darkness before the dawn was spread there also
when we stood at the bus stand felt as if the next moment someone would come with pistol and run away with all our luggages
both of us immediately returned back to the station
we started looking at the pictures of world war ii trophies etc hung in the small room at the station
before coming to italy whenever we mentioned about our proposed visit to sicily to our acquaintances there was same reaction hey why are you going to sicily do nt you know that it is the center of mafia
and what is so great about sicily
in sicily one thing mafia and another one is etna volcano
both are dangerous
this curiosity of everybody was natural
as much as we know about italy lrb rome vatican venice leaning tower of pisa rrb the least we know about sicily
sicily the largest island in the mediterranean sea has remained under the domination of many countries from the ancient time due to its military and commercial importance because of its geographical location
sicily is often referred to as the ball of the boot of italy lrb because of its map rrb too
due to the influence of various civilizations and cultures fascinating confluence of greek roman spanish african and arabic can be seen in sicily architechture and lifestyle
first of all the tribes of cylian siculiana illinium etc started living in sicily
the greeks arrived in sicily in the th century bc who founded the cities
cities like syracuza lrb syracuse rrb messina catania agrigento etc grew rapidly in sicily
rome conquered sicily in bc
following the division of roman empire sicily became part of byzantium empire
the arabics captured sicily in ad
roger hoisted the norman flag in sicily in
after that sicily was respectively ruled by roman empire lrb holy roman empire rrb france spain and australia
at the time of unification of italy in sicily was merged in italy but its autonomy in the internal affairs continues
the independent parliament of sicily designs its own independent law
after spending hour at the station we reached to the bus stand again and by that time it had become quite bright
lady standing there assured us that the bus was about to come
the bus arrived and climbing on the inaccessible hill terrain it took us to the summit in minutes
one can enjoy the tour of both the hill station and the sea beach in taormina
hiking lovers can climb on etna and arab fort
people fond of sea sports can enjoy waterskiing boating etc at the beach
we had breakfast at the bus terminus
by that time the manager of the guest house herself came to receive us
we kept the luggage in the guest house and after bathing headed out for walk
the greek theatre built in the rd century bc on the highest peak of the city is the major attraction of taormina
the greek theatre has been built under the open sky
in the greek theatre half moon shaped stairs are made by cutting out rocks for the audience to sit and the theater is at the bottom
the appearance of this stadium more than thousand years old has changed several times
some spanish chieftain had made his house in this greek theatre
the roman rulers made it an arena for gladiator competitions
music concert ballet dance drama etc are organized in the greek theatre even at present
one can easily imagine how supernatural how unique the pleasure and experience of dance and music sitting in the lap of nature under the shade of moon and stars might be
there are roman theatre big church the fort built by the arabs in the th century museum and art gallery too in taormina
we did see some of these but frankly speaking nothing else impressed as much after seeing the greek theatre
etna is the world biggest and active volcano
new information we received is that dormant volcano is more dangerous than an active volcano
it is difficult to guess about dormant volcano when the volcano will explode and how terrible it will be
on the other hand the active volcano constantly keeps on emitting smoke
the chances of explosion of an active volcano being disastrous is less
our next stop was syracuza or syracuse
syracuza city was formed by the corinth gasis in bc
within years syracuza city became so powerful that it became the eyesore of athens state
every now and then there used to be war between both the states
once the navy of athens attacked from sides with entire ship fleet
but instead of winning the whole fleet of athens went into the sea
to go from taormina to syracuse we had to change bus at catania the headquarters of mafia
the famous fountain of catania main church and famous idol made of lava running hastily we saw all
we reached to syracuse after the journey of hour
the bus terminus is in ortigia island so we got down there itself
ortigia has been connected with the rest of the city through bridge
apollo temple of the sixth century bc is the oldest monument of the city
but we saw nothing like indian temple in the apollo temple
the broken base of poles in field surrounded by stones some fractured stone statues and broken pieces were kept with utmost care
there is monument of st lucy at short distance from this church
it is favorite place of the local residents as it is built on the seaside
the seaside becomes very charming in the evenings
there is spring of sweet water here located merely metres from the sea
the wall of this part of ortigia has been built by pushing the sea water behind as if an ocean fort
there is sitting arrangement of thousand people in the western part of syracuse
when we descended from the hill with the theater we saw the caves built there in which prisoners and slaves used to break cut and carve stones once upon time
among these caves the mouth of the metres high and metres deep cave is very narrow
because of this strange creation the shape of this cave really looks like human ear
the sound echoes lot in this cave
it is said that the officers of the king atop the hill could clearly hear the conversation of the prisoners breaking stones in the cave below
the ancient roman arena and the giant stone sacrifice altar are the other attractions of this area
stone sacrifice altar in which to animals could be slaughtered together
the stones of the arena had been uprooted to create the sea wall of ortigia island
it took us long time to see the objects from ancient time to present time in syracuse museum
suddenly we got startled when we glanced the clock
we took taxi to reach to the bus stand and breathed sigh of relief after reaching the guest house by pm running around
the next day we took leave from taormina and arrived at agrigento the valley of the temples
some girls of the guest house had warned us that these temples of agrigento were very fragmented
yet these temples of agrigento are counted among the world leading greek temples
when we took bus from rozali square lrb piazza rozali rrb and arrived at sicily capital palermo it had become night
fortunately our hotel was near the bus stand itself and we easily located it out
we were amused on reaching at the hotel
once upon time this hotel must have been the house of powerful priest pundit or chieftain
wide marble staircase large rooms with high ceilings large balcony soft and soothing mattresses and attached bathroom
usually this last feature is not available for people on mediumbudget like us
norman kings had made palermo the capital during their rule
some travelers and historians of the medieval period had counted palermo as one of the most beautiful cities of europe
cathedral the main church of palermo is magnificient building built in norman style
geometric vines on the outer walls of cathedral church reflect arabic influence
on one of the walls of the cathedral church the verses of quran have been carved
the graves of roger ii henry vi and fredric ii are built in the cathedral church
the huge dome of cathedral church was built in the th century
mosaic art has been extensively used in the churches and palaces of sicily
in mosaic art floors and walls are beautifully decorated by coloring small pieces and thin chips of stones with various colors and sticking them closely
that place adorned with mosaic art appears as if carpet has been layed or panel has been hung
the main square of palermo city is called quattro canti lrb four corners rrb
same style of houses were built at the four corners in order to decorate the square
the main gate of those houses and statues standing nearby are also similar
the name of the fountains built at pretoria square of palermo city was although fontana pretoria
the citizens used to feel so ashamed to see the naked statues built at pretoria square that they started calling it fountain of rome or fountain of shame
the construction of santa maria la nuova church of monreal only kilometres far from palermo was done by william ii the grandson of roger ii in the last years of the th century
santa maria la nuova church looking plain from outside looked normal from inside
the large gates of the church were built by prominent architects of italy out of which the middle gate is built of copper
we did bit of shopping after returning from monreal and then got busy packing luggage on reaching at the hotel
we were satisfied that the travel had concluded safely and happy that all the misunderstandings regarding sicily had been cleared as well
earlier the capital of marwar state was mondor
ridmal founded mondor by winning it with his own muscle power
ridmal son jodha did not like mondor
although mondor city was settled on the high rocks of vihangakut mount
there was dense forest all around mondor city

the train had reached katni earlier but on january we got the train to prayag after five oclock
in the morning hours we were moving on the way from kaushambhi to dakshinapath through tripuri jabalpur
our train was moving towards prayag carrying the crowd of both makar sankranti and somwari amavasya
we arrived at prayag by eleven oclock and this time our halt was at the house of pundit vrajmohan vyas
pundit vrajmohan was the executive officer of municipality at that time
vyasji had gone to banaras we learned that he had waited for our arrival
now we had to stay in prayag for few days
we got off at mughalsarai to catch the train to banaras
we found shri chetsingh jaiswal and kshirod babu going towards the train to patna in mughalsarai
they were returning from their leisure walk now
on reaching at banaras after sunset we became the guests of dr mangal dev shastri
in dr mangal dev shastri house too the walls had cracked at some places due to the earthquake
the impact of earthquake on the houses of banaras as it appears was more than prayag
we got special edition of leader on th from which some confirmed news about partial devastation of north bihar were received
three hundred people died in darbhanga city due to earthquake
the death toll due to earthquake in muzaffarpur city reached up to one thousand
people died in patna because of the earthquake
from patna to raxaul the land on the sides has sunken due to the earthquake
due to the earthquake at many places in muzaffarpur and champaran districts water has come out from inside the earth
hot water has come out in patna after the earthquake
got down at bankipur station after sunset
jayaswalji ran and embraced
he had come from ajmer on receiving wire message for some trial and stayed in darbhanga during the earthquake
however the people coming to bankipur had understood that he too had been sacrificed in the earthquake
the people coming to bankipur did not get way to come or go anywhere for two days
all of sudden they caught some motor car and reached barauni and came to patna crossing the ganges
the reports of the earthquake were still in the air
the knowledgeable astrologers of the country were saying that they had already done prediction for it and still more earthquakes would be occuring
the thrust of earthquake gets chance to make less damage due to wooden frame
perhaps the arches not being in use as much in our this zone is also because of the fear of the earthquake
wherever jayswalji had put arch in his mansion all the places had developed cracks due to the earthquake
at night we crossed the ganges by steamer and marched to board the train for muzaffarpur at the other side
pundit jawaharlalji had arrived at patna hearing the news of earthquake in bihar and was traveling by the same steamer
one gentleman had already been sent to hajipur so that he would keep motor car ready for muzaffarpur
it was quite dark when we arrived at hajipur
after running around quickly we got taxi for sixteen rupees for miles
the road was soft which was also broken at several places so the motor had no space to run everywhere
the impact of earthquake was completely visible on the houses on the way
the water that had come out from the ground had collected in the form of lake
we arrived at muzaffarpur town observing all these
what to talk of the earthquake play at muzaffarpur
people were camping in the fields of muzaffarpur and lying
the building of the court had broken in muzaffarpur
in muzaffarpur the injured were kept in the huts prepared outside the hospital
people had left their homes and camped in the campus of chandwara darbhanga tinkuthia
grains and blankets were being distributed by the government in muzaffarpur
spotted two dead bodies being taken out from the debris and carried outside infront of me
the lal kothi of muzaffarpur was also destroyed
there was no house left in muzaffarpur which did not suffer any damage
the earthquake had some special enmity with the towers of the temples and mosques of muzaffarpur
during the earthquake the land in sitamarhi started cracking like cucumber stream of water also burst out at various places there
the water flooded because of this
at some places this crack had gone far into the ground
at some places water came out of the ground like fountain and heaped around the water mouth like sanddome as the mouth of volcano
the land of sitamarhi we were going to there the land had become like sieve with these water currents
millions of tons of sand had surfaced from the groove of the earth
if only water and not sand had come out from the earth the terrible condition caused due to flood of water would not have happened
the sand had bridged many fields of sitamarhi
no idea how much land of sitamarhi will remain uncultivable for how long due to this
lot of sand was lying in the fields of jhapha sugar mills and the mills too had suffered lot of damage
we came by onehorsecart for eight miles lrb dharmpur rrb

bhagirathi lrb ganga rrb river flows in the south of chhapra
the impact of earthquake on the coast of sarayu was the same as we had seen at allahabad at the time of earthquake
couple of houses in majhi were torn
we went towards the old fort of majhi lrb usrain rrb
we thought some land might have torn in the old fort so we might find any archaeological tableau
statue of buddha of praguemuslim era was found in the old fort of majhi
the ancientness of this fort is proven by this statue
this fort of majhi has now been abandoned for many centuries because no sign of wall or life etc is found beyond this
the square land of this fort of majhi is cultivated at present
there is way for water flow near the eastern end of the fort
various shapes and sizes of bricks are found in this
some sandal trees were found at the same place of this canal at the eastern end of majhi fort
vaidyaraj ramraksh whom we used to call tuntun had been appointed here as physician by the district board for some time now
vaidyaraj ramraksh had found out this sandal
when vaidyaraj ramraksh told me initially could not believe it
sandal belongs to malayagiri how is its presence possible here
when went there myself and smelled it what could be the reason to deny it
at the same moment rememebered things written by kashikchandan in pali script
just across the other side of saraju visible in front was the kashi country
this sandal of majhi indicated that at some point of time there used to be good sandal in kashi
can not compare the fragrance but the smell of the wood there was very nice
the way from chhapra to banaras used to pass through the bridge of majhi
the earthquake had broken the bridge of majhi so the train could not run on that
the company had brought ship by which people used to cross over
the trains of both sides used to come and stand at the sides
as the railway bridge of majhi was broken we boarded the ship after reaching the banks
the ship used to start from extreme east and bank at the extreme west
after crossing saraju we came to the erstwhile combined state and present uttar pradesh
saraju is the border of uttar pradesh and bihar
strange unruliness is seen in saraju too due to nonformation of linguistically based provinces
we arrived at sultanganj lrb bhagalpur rrb on th march
initially we felt irritation in our throat in sultanganj
actually we had been coughing for many days but we were thinking that the reason behind it was the earthquake water of sitamarhi
while going to sultanganj jamalpur came on our way
the houses of jamalpur were severely damaged by the earthquake
on th march we went out to take tour of sultanganj
the bunglow of kumar krishnanandji which was over the fort had fallen due the earthquake

our program was to see the famous lake manyara national park while returning from ngorongoro national park
we could not resist the desire of seeing olduvai valley located in the east of ngorongoro conservation area one of the world most important sites in terms of archaeology
the skull of about years old human ancestor was found in olduvai valley the credit of which goes to dr leakey
archaeological discoveries of dr leakey have worldwide reputation
these days that skull is stored in the national museum of daressalam
the fossilized residues of the animals extinct several years ago which were discovered in the same area are stored in the museum built near olduvai valley
on seeing this museum we started sinking into the atmosphere of millions of years before
we all enjoyed seeing the fossils lot
now we started worrying about entering into the lake manyara national park
the day was ending and there was little time
yet the desire to see lake manyara national park was getting stronger
we certainly did not want to miss the opportunity of seeing manyara park as it was kilometers down from the gornagoro park
there was half an hour left for the last entry
thanks to the driver we had reached to lake manyara national park in time
we breathed sigh of relief as soon as the jeep entered the lake manyara national park
lake manyara national park is situated about kilometres away in the southwest of arusha
the beautiful view of metres tall western wall of the great rift valley can be seen from here
infact the great rift valley is that part of the transformation formed on the earth upper surfaces which is spread over wide area from turkey to kenya
this transformation gets divided in the eastern and western parts in kenya
lake manyara national park is situated in the eastern part
the word manyara is supposed to have originated from plant named euphorbia tirurviea tirucalli
the people of masai tribe use this plant to make fence around their houses
at some point of time manyara was the favorite hunting ground of professional hunters but now it has changed into beautiful national park
although manyara national park is spread over only square kilometres in terms of area but its versatile wild estate bears altogether different feature
manyara lake is spread over approximately square metres
there is dense forest on the banks of manyara lake
we wanted to see the maximum in minimum time
in lake manyara national park first of all we got to see wild pig and wild cat
the long teeth of the pigs were making them horrific
the power of pigs is vested in their teeth only
on several occasions the pig gathers courage to confront even tiger with the help of these teeth
we were mesmerized by seeing hundreds of hippopotamuses lying in the manyara lake
some hippopotamuses were also walking outside the manyara lake
soon after walking for some distance into the manyara park we encountered herd of elephants moving around in the bushes
then suddenly we spotted baboons in the manyara park
there is large number of baboons in lake manyara park
baboons are called judges in swahili
due to the geographical location of lake manyara national park two types of species of baboons are found here
yellow baboons are in the southeast and olive baboons in the northwest of tanzania
in lake manyara park such hybrid baboons are present which have traits of both the species mentioned above
we were surprised to see some baboons sitting alert on trees on the high branches
we were told that the baboons do like this when they sense danger
the baboons get down from the trees after the danger is gone
these baboons were sleeping on the trees in manyara park
baboons select their favorite tree to sleep
now we were anxious to see the lions resting on the trees of manyara park
had read that like the famous serengeti national park the lions and leopards in lake manyara too have the unique habit of resting on trees which is not found in any other national park in the world
lions can often be seen sitting and comfortably dozing off on the branches of akesia trees at height of feet in manyara national park
there are many logics behind this habit of the lions few reasons as cited are to avoid flies to enjoy the breeze to keep an eye on the herds of zebras and buffaloes passing by to keep safe from the herds of elephants
was just thinking about the strange habit of lions resting on the trees in several national parks of east africa when suddenly the driver stopped the jeep and pointed us towards tree
we were stunned to see two long tails hanging down
when we turned our neck upwards we found two giant lions resting on the tree
for while we kept on enjoying this beautiful and exciting scene breathtakingly
we were surprised to see the skulls horns and skeletons lying at several places
these bones must be that of the wild animals which might have become the prey of the lions and leopards
the lions in manyara park mostly prey on buffaloes zebras and wild beasts for food
the lions in manyara park mostly prey on buffaloes zebras and wild beasts for food
like other parks of east africa we saw large mud molehills of termites at several places in manyara national park too
these termites are also called brown ants in several areas
but these termites of manyara park are neither brown nor they are ants
these termites are the primitive species of insects connected with cockroaches at some level
termites are called machawa in swahili
while seeing the rich resource of wild animals of manyara national park we arrived at the grassy land between masasa and chem rivers
we chanced upon the opportunity of seeing zebras again in this grassy land
zebra shy animal with black stripes on white body is called punda milia lrb striped donkey rrb in swahili
no doubt the appearance of zebra somehow resembles donkey
zebras often become the prey of lions
lions savor zebra flesh the most
on an average zebras live for years
according to wildlife scientists zebra lifespan can be years too
zebras are the pride of east africa
when excited zebras produce sound like barking
zebras found in manyara are of equus burchelli species as defined by the burchell
elephants are as such mostly found at several places in the park but being wandering creatures they also go to the jungles of nearby nadala basin
nadala basin where the elephant research camp is located
elephant is an important part of the abundant wild treasure of manyara national park
we encountered herd of elephants while moving around in lake manyara national park
children enjoyed watching two tiny elephant calves walking along with the herd of elephants lot
the height of an elephant at the time of birth is only cm
those two little elephants must have been about metre tall
the age of those tiny elephants must have been just few months old
in order to protect their cubs from lions and other animals elephants keep them right in the middle
the african elephant lrb loxodonta africana rrb which is called tembo sa dovu in swahili is slightly larger than the asian elephant
the ears of the african elephants are also big
lake manyara national park is the haven for more than almost elephants
we had just walked bit in the park when three to four elephants came out of the bushes and stood infront
the jeep had to be stopped but engine was kept running
the driver told that we had to wait until the elephants voluntarily walked away from there
we were in fix
evening had begun to darken
the twitter of birds was increasing
birds were returning to their nests
fortunately after some time the elephants moved away from our path walking in an intoxicated manner
an elephant made loud scream
it is said about the elephants that they make contact with other fellow elephants located miles away by producing some special kind of sound
nowadays research has been going on about the sounds of elephants
many times the male elephants fight with each other on the issue of developing relation with the female elephants
we kept on watching the elephants disappearing in the bushes quietly
just as we arrived at bagayo basin we got an opportunity to see black rhinoceroses lrb diceros bicornis rrb
black rhinoceros known as kifaru in swahili language is found not only in the bagayo basin but also in the other areas of the park
the black rhinoceros weighing two tonnes gets violent any moment and does not even hesitate to attack the vehicles and harm them
black rhinoceroses have an intense auditory and olfactory sense
but the visual sense of black rhinoceroses is equally weak
even the lion the king of jungle considers it rather safe to parry away from fully grown black rhinoceros
white rhinoceroses which are found in the northwestern uganda and southern sudan are not present in the lake manyara national park
though the names indicate difference but the color of both the species of rhinoceros is more or less brown beige
the mouth of white rhinoceros is squarish more suited for grazing grass while the mouth lrb or snout rrb of black rhinoceros is somewhat pointed
there are several legends about the horn of rhinoceros popular among the african people
the horn which is not horn but actually hard bunch of hair is useful in medicine in the opinion of africans
although scientists have proven that this is only myth but many rhinoceros in africa have had to lose their lives in past due to these and many other myths
now the situation has improved
more than black rhinoceros are enriching the lake manyara national park
we were surprised to see huge pile of animal dung at one place in the lake manyara park
we came to know that it was the dung of rhinoceroses
we were told that rhinoceroses have strange habit of passing stool at fixed location
many legends related to this fact are popular among the african people
the view of lake manyara looks beautiful from between the bagayo and andibash rivers due to the height
we were admiringly watching the beautiful scene of lake manyara
manyara lake situated at height of metres from the sea level and spread over square kilometres is paradise for nature lovers
the water level of manyara lake keeps on changing every year
there are various types of fishes in manyara lake
cat fish clarias bream and tilapia are the main in manyara lake
lot of conch shells and shells were lying at the banks of lake manyara
unpolished conch shell picked up from the bank of lake manyara is still present with me in its original form and reminds me of those golden moments
our desire to see the tallest animal on earth giraffe had not been fulfilled yet
there is considerably good number of giraffes in lake manyara national park
we were about to return from the manyara national park when our search was complete
some giraffes taking out their long tongues were satisfying their hunger with the leaves of nearby trees
had an immense satisfaction to see giraffe the beautiful national animal of tanzania
the happiness of children had no bounds
as matter of fact we all had seen giraffe for the first time
there are star like spots on the bodies of giraffes found in lake manyara
whereas there are net like spots on the bodies of giraffes found in the southern kenya and other places
giraffe lrb giraffa camelopardalis rrb is called twiga in swahili
regarding its biological nomenclature the zoological scientists have the opinion that giraffe is probably hybrid species made from the combination of camel and leopard
while walking giraffes raise both the legs on one side and move forward like camels
the extremely long neck of giraffe helps it to eat the leaves located at height on akesia trees
contrary to the popular belief giraffe sleeps lying down but the neck is upright
we reached at maji moto in the final stage of visiting lake manyara national park
there are hot water springs in maji moto
the water coming out of the earth womb at degrees centigrade is the symbol of amazing powers of the nature
hot water comes out from the infinitive depth of the earth through the contours of rocks
remembered sohna hot waterfall and tattapani hot waterfall of my country
we were surprised to see different kinds of algae lrb kai rrb developed in hot water
we were at the southern end of lake manyara national park
there was no exit door at the southern end of the park
so we had to return to the northern exit gate
we returned with the memories of beautiful picturesque of extremely rich wild animal treasure cherished in our heart
evening was growing
the sun was about to sink
the golden rays of the setting sun was giving reddish tinge to the water of manyara lake
this was an extremely beautiful view of manyara lake never to be forgotten
the rays falling on the fishes peeking out of water or jumping in the manyara lake were giving them supernatural and marvellous aura
wanted to absolutely assimilate that unbelievable scene
the time was getting over
the sun god had set by the time we returned
slowly it was getting dark
staying inside the manyara park any longer was no less than dangerous
it is completely prohibited for the tourists to stay inside the park after seven oclock
while returning we saw several species of birds too
various birds including different species of cranes ducks woodpeckers are an integral part of the famous lake manyara park
our heart started jumping with excitement on seeing the herd lrb row rrb of deers of impala species just as we were heading for the exit gate
it is rare to get such good luck in the final stage
this beautiful animal known as swalapala in swahili language was doubling the beauty of this park
this deer of impala species grazes as well as eats leaves and buds
this beautiful deer found in the southern and eastern africa is an expert in taking long jump
this deer is called zulu in south africa
zulu is capable of taking feet high and feet long jumps
while coming towards the entrance gate was silently watching this extremely beautiful wild animal called swalapala or zulu galloping
we took glance at the lake manyara park for the last time and came out of the park with heavy heart
night had become dark
after bathing in the beauty of this lake manyara national park enriched with famous and enchanting sceneries we were returning with wet heart
was thinking that the nature has offered precious treasure of natural wealth in abundance to this country of east africa with relatively poor but stable economy
the jeep was running fast towards arusha
strange emotion filled my heart
eyelashes got moist
rolled down the jeep window pane
my tired and heavy eyelashes started to shut down due to the cold breeze
my mind was also running fast along with the jeep felt as if something was left behind

the major destinations for tourists of japan thailand and sri lanka are the well known buddhist destinations sarnath kushinagar bodhgaya sanchi amravati and dharmashala
some foreign tourists find solace with the darshan of krishna life at vrindavan mathura
some foreign tourists find spiritual peace by staying in the ashrams of rishikesh
tourists also go to auroville near pondicherry and osho ashram of poona for peace
like spiritual peace large number of tourists also visit here for physical benefit
there are various world famous destinations of natural medicine yoga and spa therapy etc in our country for acquiring energy
there are several such places in kerala and uttarakhand
as compared to indian tourists more foreign tourists come to these places of india
kerala for natural medicine and rishikesh for yoga are world famous destinations
there is lot of importance of fairs and festivals in our country multicoloured culture
foreign tourists can be seen taking part in the pushkar fair and desert festival of rajasthan dance festival of khajuraho and mahabalipuram ladakh festival
foreigners too can be seen participating in hampi festival of karnataka rath yatra festival of orissa boat race festival of kerala
new dimension of eco tourism has started in our country in the form of village tourism few years ago
apart from the rich tourists of our country village tourism has been immensely liked by foreign tourists
the attraction of home stay has also joined with the village tourism
on the other side our country has also made its identity as corporate tourism destination
there are world level convention centres in several cities of india
not only this due to different identity formation of indian designers in the global fashion world about decade ago the fashion tourism had started here
since then several big fashion event and shows like mr international have been hosted in india
through them inbound tourism has grown continuously in the country of india
with the commonwealth games being organized in the coming year indian tourism will get more boost
it is hoped that india will emerge as destination with diversity
vijaya dashami dussehra festival celebrated as symbol of the victory of the truth over the untruth and the good over the bad is major festival of north india
in the staging of ramlilas running for nine days the life sketch of lord rama is shown
on the day of dussehra the effigies of ravana kumbhakarna and meghnada are burnt
thousands of visitors come to see ramlila
this festival ends with the acclaim of lord ram
the dussehra of kullu lrb himachal pradesh rrb also has special place of its own
statues of deities from different temples of the province are brought with extreme reverence in palanquins and dolis to shri raghunath temple of kullu
there is custom of special worship in kullu
on the occasion of dussehra huge fair is also held in the field of kullu
it is spectacular to the decorated shops the courage of children women men and elders dressed in colorful dresses
on the occasion of dussehra there stays stir of music and folk dance in kullu
starting from dussehra this festival of kullu runs for week
the form of dussehra celebrated in jagdalpur of bastar district of chattishgarh state is bit different
the shobha yatra of maa danteshwari the founding goddess of the state holds the chief center of attraction of dussehra
on the occasion of dussehra the doli of mother danteshwar is brought from dantewada to jagdalpur
after worship in jagdalpur it is seen off for dantewada
dussehra is major festival of bastar residents
tribals from all the nook and corners of bastar region come to participate in the merrimaking festival of dussehra
it is said that in th century the fourth king of kakatia dynasty purushottam dev had started the dussehra festival in bastar
the dussehra of mysore of karnataka is celebrated in different style
it is said that the dussehra of mysore started as symbol of victory of chamundi devi over the demon mahishasur
on this occasion royal demonstration proceeds from the palaces of rajmahal
in this procession of mysore besides different glimpses the decorated elephants are center of special attraction
on the day of navami after the prayer from the juloos palace this procession reaches banni mandap through major roads of the cities
at night in banni mandap the torch parade and the attractive rhythms of the police band charm the minds of the gathered crowd of people
in west bengal after the prayers running for nine days on dussehra there is tradition of dispersing honourably the statues of mother durga in the ocean and the rivers
come today we will tell you about the trishul mountain peak
you must have seen the statues of lord shankar and his pictures several times
in them you must have seen his weapon trident
the name of snow peak located in the mountain ranges of the himalaya is based on the same trident
you would think whether this peak looks like trident
trishul peak though does look like trident but like trident it does have three peaks
these are called trident one trident two and trident three
the highest trident is trident one
the height of trident one from the sea level is metres
second and third peaks are respectively metres and metres
to tell you one more thing all these three peaks are joined together through ridge
trishul peak is located in the bageshwar district of uttarakhand
bageshwar is in the western part of kumaun
this peak is considered sacred in bageshwar
you know initially when there were attempts to climb this peak then the porters there used to forbid to climb the trishul peak
in their eyes trishul peak is sacred and worshipped mountain peak
after several attempts the first attempt to reach trishul peak was made in
then longstaff along with two other mountaineers some guides and porters had become successful in touching this peak
he had chosen the way of snow river through valley
on the way he also had to face some snowy storms at some places but he never gave up
one special thing is that trishul was the highest peak then among the snow peaks of the himalayas
that is when the man won it there was no other peak higher than trishul touched by man
to tell you one more interesting thing in in campaign of yugoslavia mountaineers had crossed the ridges of all the three peaks together
during the climb of the mountains at some places they also had to cross mountains like walls of snow
for this these mountaineers had to climb while making way in the snow through axe
it is surprising that two members of this campaign had done paragliding from the trishul peak
for mountaineering on trishul group one has to go to base camp in kumaun through almora kausani gualdam debal bedini bugyal and rupkund
you know that every person can not do mountaineering
every person has the desire to see this sacred peak of the himalaya
therefore if you wish to see the pleasant form of trishul peak then you can go to kausani
there are several view points in kausani from where trishul snow peak can be viewed
just think when you see all the three snow covered peaks of the trishul mountain peak you will also wish to be mountaineer
at that time the most direct way of the travel to bengal from manipur used to go through kachaar
bhagyachandra also wanted to use the same way
the king of kachaar could not accept this
he got two messengers of the king killed and also warned him of bad consequences
in this situation maharaj bhagyachandra had to move towards shrihatt lrb silhat rrb by catching the route of southern forest
this way of shrihatt was so difficult that the elephant could not be ridden there
the king had to ride on the horse back
british officer francis hamilton has reported in account of assam the number of people going in this journey along with king bhagyachandra to be seven hundred
in this journey of bhagyachandra the carriers themselves were three hundred
the narration of this journey of king bhagyachandra was written on the initiative of lavanyachandra
navchand haricharan and madhavrao vahed ba told the details of this journey to khagendra minaba haricharan khagemba veermani loremba and khodchon ahaiba
together they prepared this travelogue of bhagyachandra
in the published form of this travelogue at the end of the book the editor has also given the meaning of difficult words alphabetically
with this understanding this travelogue for the usual readers of the present form of manipuri language has become easy
the credit of laying the foundation of modern manipuri travelogue literature goes to travel article of hijam iravat published in ad
titled mandlegi khong fam lrb the journey of mandley rrb this article is the detail of the journey done by iravat to participate in the third convention of nikhil hindu maniputi mahasabha held in mandley the same year from february to march
this journey had started from vattagram by ship on february
iravat paid special attention towards the thing that hotels in the ship were after the names of hindu and muslim lrb hindu hotel musalman hotel rrb
the naming of streets were also based on religions
several clubs related to the activities of trekking and rock climbing have into existence these days
these clubs take their members for trekking and rock climbing to mountains
after achieving expertese in these activities members are taken to high mountain place for climbing
where they easily learn the methods of ice and snow crafts
enough knowledge can be gained about this game if one goes for trekking and rock climbing etc with an experienced friend or trainer
initially one should go out to mountain places with anyone on any holiday
later the person himself becomes used to this game
by reading the history of mountaineering one gets to know that most of the accidents take place due the mistake of the climbers themselves
on several occasions climbers take wrong decisions
they have to pay for these wrong decisions of mountaineers
therefore it is necessary that we should be able to choose right and wrong in time
the biggest principle in mountaineering is to save oneself
for this it is necessary to know that during mountaineering there is no place for emotions like defeat and victory
this game of mountaineering brings the climber very near to the wholeness full of the beauty of nature
mountaineering keeps the player physically and mentally awake
in this game the person recognizes his physical stength along with mental alertness
player gets face to face with the mountaines openly
other members of the team watch each of his activities
the virtues that develop in the mountaineers during mountaineering are helpful in the formation of his character
today there is lack of such people in in country who can provide leadership to the society
this lack can be fulfilled with the virtues developed during mountaineering
like hockey footbal and cricket etc in mountaineering also special kind of shoes are necessary
for mountaineering it is extremely mandatory for the shoes to be comfortable reliable and convinient
mountaineers have to spend the most of his time on snow and glaciers
mountaineers should not show any kind of carelessness in the matter of shoes
double layered water proof shoes are needed in mountaineering
while buying shoes for mountaineering it should be considered that they can protect feet from melting in extreme cold
when one has to stay for long in the snow then to keep shoes dry an outer show is used over it
due to being water proof such shoes of nylon save the shoes from getting wet
due to these shoes the leather of the internal shoes does not get frozen at heights
if such shoes are not availbale then using gaiter in place of that is good
aluminium foil is very useful for mountaineers to escape from cold
according to their needs mountaineers use aluminium foil
aluminium foil is very thin like paper
the shape of aluminium foil can be made very small by folding
so small that mountaineer can even keep the aluminium foil in his pocket
to escape from extreme cold some people also use the aluminium file as tent
some mountaineesr wrap the aluminium foil around their body and sleep in the sleeping bag
before wearing shoes and socks if aluminium foil is wrapped around the feet then it is very helpful in keeping the feet warm
feet are also very comfortable in aluminium foil
for protecton from snowy fast winds wind shielder clothes are brought to use
during mountaineering one should always keep wind shielder coat with him
just as one experiences the need one should wear the wind shielder coat immediately
in wind shielder coat there is big pocket towards the front and two pockets on the sides
besides food items lunch packet dry raisins pairs of gloves and socks spectacle protecting one from the glare of snow diar whistle and torch can easily be kept in the wind shielder coat
cap is attached with the wind shielder coat or jacket of this type
head neck and ears can be covered with this
where there is too much of snow or there is slippage on the snow wind there shielder pants are used
wind shielder pants are also made of good variety of wind shielder cloth
therefore wind shielder pants are very light
the amount of cold on high mountains can not be estimated while living in the fields
to escape from this cold wind shielder and water proof clothes made of nylon are used
soft feathers of good quality are filled in the wind shielder clothes
wind shielder clothes are used in extreme cold at heights while mountaineering or at night when it gets very cold
in such wind shielder jacket or coat there are caps and pockets
wind shielder clothes are used as per needs
in mountaineering hands have to work comparatively more than any other parts of the body
therefore protecting hands in every way is very necessary
if climbing is done in lower areas in the winter season even then woolen gloves are needed
in snow and cold one can not even imagine to ascend without wind shielder clothes
climber has to use sun hat beret hat cap helmet sun glasses and snow goggles etc regularly
as there are no trees and other greenery on high mountains the air there has less oxigen
on high mountains the rays of sun fall directly on the body
open parts of body get very soon affected with the rays of the sun
the spectacle used in the snow to protect from the glare and shine of the snow is necessary equipment for the mountaineers
with the shine of the snow the possibility of snow blindness is always there
taking ordinary bed for mountaineering can never be imagined
for mountaineering campaign sleeping bag can be used
sleeping bag is like bag
getting inside sleeping bag climber can sleep comfortably
the lining of sleeping bag is very light warm and hot being filled with soft feathers of nylon of birds
after lying in the sleeping bag the mountaineer closes himself from inside with the help of zip
there is also cap in the sleeping bag to cover the head
the cold of mountains can be easily challenged while sleeping in the sleeping bag
if you look at the history of mountaineering then you will find that there has been several ups and downs in it
from the start itself several unwanted circumstances have face to face in mountaineering
at times several accidents have also beein occurring in mountaineering
it has been occurring mainly because of the lack of equipments of good quality and technical knowledge developed in the area of mountaineering
besides this difficulties occur also because of the ignorance and inexperience of climbers
the history of mountaineering in india is not very old
in the form of adventurous game this would be considered totally new activity
when in may tenzing norgay along with edmund hillary climbed the highest mountain peak everest then the attention of indians also got attracted towards this adventurous game
there is no doubt in it that like other games risks are to be taken even during mountaineering
may be compared to some other games mountaineering has little more risks
due to accidents climbers have also lost their lives several times
it does not mean that one should not do mountaineering
there is no aspect of life which is untouched from accidents
so should one stop traveling or not do daily works
doing this is not possible
if it is so then why be afraid of mountaineering
during mountaineering person gets the opportunity to test his virtures like strength selfconfidence courage and leadership etc
person does not only enjoy the pleasure of natural beauty rather he himself lives in lap of the nature
it has been seen often that on mountains most of the accidents take place due to the equipments of mountaineering
not making any plans for any campaign and not being cautious of the problems which are known become the cause of accident
due to more experience credible equipments and planned method in mountaineering the extent of safety in has increased very much in it
mountaineer faces difficult situation with his intelligence and the capacity to organise
through this along with physical development of the climber his intellectual and mental development also take place
mountaineering obstacles can be divided into three categories
natural obstacles personal obstacle and mental obstacles
during mountaineering the most prominent and the most complex natural obstacle is that of avalanche
there is huge lump of unstable snow on mountains which starts sloping down due to any reason
avalanche is that big lump of snow which shakes from it place for any reason and starts slipping down on the slope of the mountain
the slope which has its angle more than degrees has chance of avalanche
while crossing such places or while climbing it one needs to be extremely careful
in mountaineering avalanche is serious problem which always stands before the climber as challenge
its consequences are very dangerous therefore they should be very alert and cautious towards this
due to this very carelessness and lack of alertness most of the accidents in the mountaines take place
avalanche is just another form of death therefore climbers should have full awareness about it
they can get completely buried under the heap of stones rocks and snow coming in avalanche
where the climber may die due to suffocation under the heap of snow
snow falls all around on the mountains
there are some places where the snow gets solid base
its layers get solidified one after another
snow falls at some slope or slant
when its shape and load get very large then slope or slants become incapable of to provide support
in the same way due to weather also the snow starts slipping from where it is standing because that has no base
avalanche can start any slope
the more the slope the more the possiblity for the avalance to start
if the slope is of dense vegetation grass trees bushes and large rocks
it gives good base to the snow
temperature air and water on mountains play very important role in making the state of the snow volatile
avalanche in mountains is very common event
due to sharp slope landslides starts very easily in heavy rains
many times when the soil below gets displaced from its place the base of the upper area is lost and the climbers start falling
often all the climbers have to face such situation
when one has to cross any such place then one needs to be very careful
often the tourists and mountaineers coming to the mountains for the first time do not give any importance of mountain rivers and moats
because they have seen big rivers in the plains
these rivers have wide banks
on the coming of floods these rivers cause havoc
therefore such climbers feel these rivers streams flowing on the mountains to be very small
at some places these river streams can also be crossed by jumping
therefore climbers start crossing it very carelessly
the reality is that if someone slips while crossing these river streams then it gets difficult for them to stand up again
limbs start freezing due to cold water flowing with speed
dangerous blow can be caused due to fall on the stones
while crossing the members of the team should tie themselves in rope
the first member of the team should move ahead while groping such crevices with the help of his ice axe
whenever one has to cross such road one should keep the equipments related to crevace along
if the crevace is narrow then members should cross while jumping one by one
every member must belay
if doing so is not possible then the team should move slowly with each member belaying
when glaciers flow on more slopy slants then they break
the part of this broken glacier is called ice fall
in the part of broken glacier the pinnacles built like peaks are called ice tower
this pinnacle is also called serac
these pinnacles are very volatile
therefore one should walk avoiding these pinnacles as much as possible
if doing so is not possible then one should take total precaution while crossing them because these pinnacles can break at any time
on mountains and specially on the himalayas the weather plays an important role in the success or failure of any mountaineering campaign
three campaigns by indians for climbing the everest in and became unsuccessful just because of bad weather
in the campaign of india had to lose five experienced mountaineers forever
rains snow or hailstorm haze or fog snowy storm darkness cold heat storm or lightening etc all are different parts of weather
in mountains weather changes suddenly
in three four days temperature changes dramatically
in mountains one can get so see any color of weather
one should use good good raincoat in case of rains or snow on the mountains
you should take off wet clothes and wear dry clothes immediately after reaching the camp
if it starts hailing or snow storms comes or high wind starts blowing or the fog or haze gets very dense then you should stop at safe place and wait for the weather to get clear
commonly on mountains the weather gets bad after noon
you should try to do all your important work in the morning
on getting stuck in snow storm you should try to take shelter amidst rocks caves or in hollows of trees
to face cold weather it is appropriate to come out for mountaineering only with woollen clothes of good variety and sleeping bag
to escape from lightening you should keep all the metallic items like ice axe piton crampons and utensils etc away from yourself
putting the rucksack down you should sit upon it yourself in such way so that feet keep touching the ground
place hands on the ears and keep your eyes closed when there is lightening
try to hold breath when there is lightening
if there has been lightening somewhere around then do not start your activities at least for thirty minutes
if there are many members in the group then move at distance at least twenty feet away from each other
if someone gets hurt by lightening treat him immediately
treat the burnt spots in the same manner as it is usually done when some part gets burnt
the third phase of mountaineering is snow climbing
first of all an individual is introduced to the mountains through trekking
he prepares himself to climb on high mountains through rock climbing
the actual mountaineering starts when person puts his first step on snow
the climbers have to face new types of difficulties in snow climbing
which he did not have to come across while doing rock climbing
so the person should be well aware of the basic fundamentals of snow climbing before going for mountaineering
if we talk of information on the situation of snow only for roaming in snow then the case will appear very complicated
only superficial things can be talked about this topic
there is no reason talking on the subject of the relation between the condition of snow on the mountains and climbing
the best way to learn about it is learning through one own experience
some practical knowledge about snow climbing definitely would be helpful to the person during snow climbing
by taking care of these things the climber is able to climb quickly and easily
the condition of snow on high mountains undergoes change very rapidly
this change is caused due to altitude temperature wind sun and the types of mountains
the higher the height of the mountains the more the snow there
the temperature of day and night becomes the cause for many changes
the change occurs due to wind too
the snow starts melting or becomes soft during daytime due to the heat of sun
the snow becomes hard at night as it gets frozen
layers of snow start forming on this hard snow
this way hard layers are formed there at the top and soft layers at the bottom
it is called hard snow in technical language
climber finds various kinds of snows like fresh snow soft snow hard snow crusted or layered snow powdery snow wet snow and thawing snow etc during mountaineering
when there is new snowfall it is clean and dry
the climber may sink deep down in this type of new snow
this new snow does not have any attachment with any object under it
the particles of new snow are not yet stuck with each other
walking in this new snow is very tiring job
after falling on the rocks and glaciers this new snow rapidly slides down
one should not cross steep slope when there has been fresh snow fall
you should cross that slope only after at least two three days
this type of snow keeps on falling usually on the himalayas
the climbers who do not care about this become the victims of an accident
if it is inevitable to cross such place then it is essential to pay attention to few things
for the sake of caution one should clear the path of such snow by throwing stones or snow balls etc
on doing so the upper layer of the snow gets displaced down
powdery snow is like fresh snow but its color is slightly greyish or brown
powdery snow looks dirty in appearance
there is very less amount of water in the powdery snow due to transformation of moisture into vapor
the temperature on the mountains in day time is high due to the direct sun rays and mild air
the snow melts and becomes wet due to this
one can put feet firmly and walk on the wet snow but boots and clothes become wet due to this
the color of wet snow is blue
this situation occurs on the mountains usually during daytime
because water keeps on flowing above and also under the wet snow
thawing snow or melting snow is more wet than even wet snow
the reason for this too is that the temperature rises during the day and reaches at freezing point during the night
if the process of melting snow goes on continuously for several days then the surface breaks down from somewhere and holes are formed at some places
it becomes difficult to cross such place too
especially during morning time when it is very slippery here
it is better to use crampons at the places of melting snow
dry snow is the one when water is not visible and the snow does not stick to the hands either
wet snow sticks to hands when pressed and water appears in it
water starts flowing from the slush snow even without pressing it
when the fist thrusts inside the snow it is soft snow
snow with medium hardness is the one when forefinger easily goes into it
hard snow is the one in which pencil would insert more easily than finger
when only the blade of knife can enter in it then it is considered extremely hard snow
one more thing that climber should keep in mind and should have complete knowledge about is the angle of the slope
before adopting any method of climbing the information about the angle of slope is as impoortant as to know what is the type of snow and how hard it is
calculating the angle of slope is also necessary because it has direct correlation with sliding of snow which starts the avalanche
innumerable climbers of mountaineering have to pass through many types of structures of snow
for example snow bridge carnis snow ridge and avalanche etc
it is very important for climber to have information about all these too because his mission can succeed only after climbing successfully on them
these structures have often become the reason of many fatal accidents
there is lot of snowfall on high mountains during winter time as the result of which rivers drains cracks and lanes etc get covered with snow
the snow starts melting and the frozen water starts flowing in summers due to sun and high temperature
large amount of snow hanging at the edge of mountains is called carnis
carnis snow brings along wind with itself which goes on depositing at the edge of the mountain
carnis usually collects at the place where ridge is steep slope from one side and its other slope is normal
the snow goes on depositing on this with the wind towards the steep slope and when it becomes too much it forms like peak and starts hanging baseless
the ridge of snow is that line where two sides of mountain meet
in other words the long narrow peak of mountain is called the ridge of snow
the shape of ridge is very sharp on high mountains
the slopes on the both sides of snow ridge can be up to to metres
it is not an easy job to climb on the snow ridge
the members should be completely billayed while walking on the snow ridge
every climber should walk on either side of the slope where he can maintain good balance
if at all one has to walk on the ridge due to some reason then he should walk from the side facing the slope
every member should bury the ice axe deep inside the snow and billay
the climber uses many kinds of techniques as per his convenience and situation for snow climbing
to cross any slope during snow climbing the climber or the climbing group has to create steps to move forward
it becomes very convenient to walk when such steps are made in fresh dry wet and soft snow
these steps are made in accordance with the nature of the slope
type of snow goal of making steps and number of members in the group too have to be taken into account for this
these steps are made in single dual or diagonal ways
when the snow is bit harder and it is not possible to make steps by pressing with foot then they are made with the kick of the boot
these steps made with the boot kick too may be single dual or diagonal
apart from the tip of the boot its both sides are also used when diagonal steps have to be made
there is extra pressure on the toes in this
so one should take care that the toes do not get injured in any condition
this is very hard job
ice axe should also be used when required
it becomes necessary to cut out stairs in the snow where the snow is extremely hard and it is not possible to make steps with kick and climbing can not be done wearing crampons either
the job of cutting out stairs in snow is usually done by ice axe
when it is not possible to cut out stairs in extremely hard snow then the work of cutting them is done with spade or the wider side of ice axe
ice axe is used from the side so that the climber does not injure himself
the stair is cut with the pointed side of ice axe and the snow is cleaned with the wider side
the last part of the stair should be tilted towards inside
snow climbing is not only difficult but also dangerous
because it is too difficult to find strong anchors in the snow and billaying is also difficult task
it is not possible to climb safely in the absence of strong anchor and not being able to billay
the fear that some accident might happen is always there in the mind of climber in such situations
it is almost impossible to avoid any accident without safe anchor and billay
billay can be done very well in the rocks and ice as strong anchor is found there
billay is not possible in fresh snow due to various reasons
yet there has been considerable reduction in accidents caused by slipping due to deadman deadboy snow stakes and snow flukes
very steep slopes are climbed by traversing or crossing the slope from one end towards the other end
in this situation the climber can use the ice axe depending on his need and the situation of slope as per any of the three ways mentioned below
on normal slopes the climber may hold the ice axe in hands keeping it above himself towards the slope
in situation of falling down the climber may pierce the tip of the ice axe and hang along with it
if the ice axe is in the lower hand the climber will have to bend down to fix it in the slope
there will be possibility of losing his balance due to this
climber can not imagine doing snow ice climbing without ice axe even for minute as it is the third leg
not only during ascending or descending climber needs an ice axe each and every moment
he can not control himself from sliding or falling without an ice axe
therefore serious accident can happen in the absence of an ice axe
climbers have been successful in saving themselves from accidents on the mountains many times due to ice axe
if the team leader reaches on flat surface and no convenient location for anchoring is visible to him then there also deadman comes in use
dig out cm deep depending on the situation of the snow there
now make vertical cut in it at the side where the place for putting rope is made
hammer the deadman at the bottom of the pit making correct angle
the access and use of deadboy are both same as deadman
snow fluke was not used as much before
it was found through experience that snow flukes were better than deadmen
snow fluke adjusts itself in the right condition with the pull of load even if it is being used in soft snow
many climbers prefer the use of snow stakes to ice axe
they think that the handle of ice axe can break
there is no fear of breaking snow stakes as it is made up of strong alloys
snow stakes are of different types small and big
snow stakes can be used as per the condition of snow
snow stakes is used both for anchoring and billaying
the slope of hard snow can be climbed by wearing crampons
in the absence of crampons the climber has to do the hard work of cutting stairs there
usually the slope with degrees can be climbed by wearing crampons
experienced climbers can climb on the sharp slope too wearing them
the climber does not have full knowledge about the kinds of places he would have to pass through on his way while mountaineering
so whether or not crampons will be used one has to go for climbing keeping them alongwith
some climbers consider the crampons necessary evil
some climbers consider crampons as deceiving equipment but the fact is that mountaineering is not possible without it
tying crampon properly is an art in itself
it requires lot of practice to tie crampons before going for mountaineering
lot of practice is required to walk wearing crampons
the climber has to get used to walking wearing crampons
he feels uncomfortable to walk with crampons
only those mountaineers should climb on the mountains with crampons who are confident of themselves
it is not very diffucult job to descend in snow
unless they are very high places as the slopes of these places are extremely difficult and the risk of falling down is also very high
even while descending the last member has to face the most problem
so the last member descending should be either the leader of the group or veteran mountaineer who can take care of himself
this is necessary because he has to climb down without billay
there is no risk in descending in soft snow
there is no risk of getting any type of serious injury even if somebody falls
nevertheless the mountaineers should not take any kind of risk while descending
one should descend carefully in proper way
when the climber comes down sitting and slipping in the snow on his own will
slipping in the snow to come down is called glissading
if the slope covered with snow is not very difficult and dangerous then the method of glissading is least time taking and enjoyable
in glissading you should ensure that the last part of the slope is visible to you or you know that you can easily stop there
glissading can be done standing too
glissading while sitting is also called optional glissading
in this the climber slides down looking towards bottom while sitting on his buttocks with his legs up
if the slope and snow are good then the climber descends down like wood floating in river
local people also use glissading method to come down
it is very painful to come down when there is too much snowfall
when there is too much snow the ice axe should be kept near chest in braking position so that it is easy to stop when required
the correct position and direction of sliding can be determined by pressing the tip of ice axe towards backside and down
if the slope is too difficult and it is not possible to descend by glissading or doing hill work then the group has to come down billaying
for billaying one should descend down extremely carefully while billaying with ice axe deadman snow stakes or snow flukes
it is necessary that the member coming at the last is the most experienced climber because he will have to come down without billay
rappelling is less time taking safe method
but for rappelling it is necessary for the climber to be extremely experienced
rappelling on snow has to be done in the same way as it is done in rock climbing
but the difference is that there is no strong anchor available on snow and the climber has to take support of artificial anchor only
these anchors can be aluminum poles snow stakes and sometimes ice axe
avoid glissading with rope
never do glissading without an ice axe
if there is no ice axe it is not possible to hold oneself if falling
never take the risk of glissading if you can not see the complete slope
glissading inside lane can be dangerous as it ends abruptly
apart from this avalanche may start too with this kind of action
it is never adivsable to do glissading wearing crampons
glissading should never be done on hard snow or ice in the morning time
glassiding should not be done on fresh snowfall
because some big stone rock or ice may have been buried under it
glissading on fresh snow may lead to accident
glissading should not be done if the snow is in the state of avalanche
it has been observed through experience that most of the accidents take place when the members of group are returning after completing the ascend
doing negligence of not using rope
it becomes impossible to hold falling climber as he is not tied with rope
the excitement of climbing peak is also mixed with negligence on such occasions
the members forget that descending is no less important task than ascending
most of the team members are dead tired while descending
the climbers fail to make balance on some difficult slopes
many accidents have taken place due to the lumps forming under crampons
climbers meet with accidents also by entangling with crampons
the climber has to cross areas filled with many kinds of ice here
such as blue ice black ice snow ice water ice white ice verglasss ice and glacier ice etc
as far as relation with mountaineering is concerned climber is only concerned with those three methods using which he has to ascend on the peak crossing those different kinds of ice zones
glacier is called the river of ice
glacier can be few hundred meters to several kilometres long
glacier flows with very slow speed
the speed of glacier can be from few centimetres to few metres in year
glacier is called river because of its flow only
there are waves waterfalls and flat surfaces in glacier like river
there are ice falls too in glacier
the surface of ice fall breaks to create huge lumps and mountain like structures of snow
crevace is formed due to bending of ice fall in any direction and presence of uneven surface under it
climbers have to cross several types of glaciers during mountaineering expedition
when there are no snow stone gravel lying on the glacier and its crevace is clearly visible then it is called dry glacier
when the glacier is filled with fresh and wet snow water is flowing on some parts of it and its crevace is covered with snow then it is called wet glacier
doing any activity or walking on the glacier is too complicated difficult and dangerous job in itself
the reason for it is its height extreme cold out there its high and low surfaces
crossing the stones and rocks lying on the glacier crossing its hidden bridges and covered crevaces is difficult
the climber must be very experienced to cross glacier
it is safe to cross the glacier on which snow is lying in the early morning in summer season
the bridges of snow that form on the glacier are also strong
as the bridges formed on snow become weak as the day progresses they start becoming unreliable
adequate experience is required to decide which way to climb the glacier
one should choose such path on which least natural obstacles are expected
in other words there is least possibility of falling stones and rocks or having avalanche
the snow lying on crevace is white whereas the snow lying on other parts of glacier is not that white
there is big difference in the whiteness of snow lying both in crevace and glacier
the snow lying on the walls of crevace is not that flat
the part in between the walls of crevace is slightly pressed
if the crevace is little wider the party can cross it by using the aluminium ladder brought along with itself
this aluminium ladder is of the type which can be kept folded
the aluminium ladder should be fixed properly on the both sides
then all the members can go across on the aluminium ladder one by one
everyone should be properly billayed
if mountaineers climb on the glacier with utmost care there is no reason why any member would fall in the crevace
nevertheless just in case some accident takes place one should go out on climbing prepared for it
usually all the methods of snow climbing are used in ice climbing too
only the condition of ice is different in ice climbing
it may be hard ice in morning and evening
it may be mixed or wet type of ice between morning and evening time
if the methods of snow climbing are not coming in use due to hard ice or because it is on glacier then one has to take help of special type of technique
these methods are generally the same which are brought into use while doing rock climbing
if the climber is not able to make space on ice with the kick of boot crampons do not hold the ice and the slope over there is sharp then he has to cut stairs or steps there
if the climber is having difficulty in maintaining his balance then he has to make hold for hand with the help of ice axe
if such holds do not seem reliable then he has to climb by hammering pitton and screw in the same way as in artificial rock climbing
when an avalanche takes place then it is bound to have difficulties while doing ice climbing above and below the carnis in the crevace and on the places with hard ice
similarly the layer frozen with particles of water and wet ice are also dangerous
if the climber does not climb with full precaution and commits small mistake or carelessness then accident takes place
like glass this layer forms on rocks and stones at the time when the rain water freezed on them due to cold
snow melts in the heat of day and freezes at night
when mountaineers go for mountaineering campaign then they continuously have to face several problems and difficulties there
while some problems in mountaineering are physical some are psychological
one also has to face several types of diseases and accidents
in mountaineering one also has to adopt safety means
several mountaineering campaigns have failed just because their plan was formulated well from the start
so much of money and time has wasted as result of mountaineering without plan
several times priceless life has also been lost
in any campaign several types of challenges have to faced
in any campaign several types of known unknown problems emerge
in any campaign of mountaineering food has very important place
the biggest thing is that finding one favorite food is not possible here
totally different environment if the climber does not find his favorite food after the tiredness exerted through continuous work then he feels even worse
along with this on mountains one needs very balanced and nutritious food
mountaineer during ascent needs calories
mountaineer needs calories at height of metres and calories above the height of metres
considering these amounts three types of menus are required
food items should be bought according to this
calculating on daily basis menu should be prepared and kept along
these days it is getting difficult to find coolies and sherpas to go the mountains
even those who agree to go to the mountains they demand much more money
thus for small campaign teams reaching mountains is getting difficult
we have already given information about several general problems
it has also been said how to escape that or how not to let them happen
here something is being said about some such problems which are related to treatment
when climber goes to high mountains for the first time for climbing then he feels the environment there totally different
the first four days of mountaineering for the mountaineer are specially difficult
the pressure of oxygen on mountains are less
any problem occuring because of the paucity of oxygen can occur in mountains
especially to youths and those who have to work more on mountains these problems disturb more
the symptoms of this disease start showing up within four to ninety hours of reaching the high mountains
mountaieers starts having complaints of headache dizziness vomiting concentration disturbance anorexia cough loose motion chest pain breathlessness weakness and swelling in feet and legs etc
its root cause is the nonadaptability of the body to the environment of the mountains
because of this several other types of problems start occurring
their end comes in the form of acute mountain sickness
when climbers reach high place then blood in the body redistributes
its best treatment is not to go up very fast
on being afflicted with the mountain sickness disease one should take total rest
in mountain sickness one gets more oxygen with long and deep breath
on taking aspirin or morphine headaches get lessened but you must take medicine with the help of doctor only
this is the most horrible form of this disease in which water gets filled in the lungs of the patient
patient climber can not take oxygen inside
with this the blood carrying veins get affected and climber falls ill
the main reason for water getting filled in the lungs is different kind of environment
rescue work in mountains is vast subject in itself
we will focus briefly on only few topics here
whenever any small or big accident takes place on mountains then there is need of rescue work there
the members of the mountaineering team have to do the rescue work themselves
but if the situation is not under their control then one might need to get help from someone
in such situation they contact one such organization which does the rescue work
generally large campaign teams have wireless
through this they keep in touch with each other
when the members of the teams that do not have wireless facility go up for climbing from the base camp then they are fully taken care of from below

this place is located at distance of kilmetres from jaisalmer
apart from traditional hill stations in the country there are several such places which are enough to impress upon anyone with its eyecatching views
one among these is also the arku valley located in the coastal hills of andhra pradesh
the truth is that the people do not know as much the valley called niligiri than the famous nilgiri of tamilnadu
just as you reach arku from the hot and humid environment its natural view and cool wind hypnotise
the name of arku valley having an expanse of kilometres is based on the arku settlement which is anonymous hill settlement
surrounded by hills and located at the heights in between to metres wherever the sight goes in arku valley it is all greenery
there are three main ways to reach arku the way most full of natural views goes through vishakhapattanam
if you want to make your journey from visakhapattanam to arku then choose the railways only and do the return journey through roadways
on this railway passing through densely populated area there is only rail service available which runs from oclock in the morning and completes the journey of kilometres up to arku by oclock
after this it goes to kirandul of dantewada lrb bastar rrb
this train gets in arku once again in return
although the time of this train starting is quarter to oclock but does passenger train get easy pass
therefore everyday it gets late in running
but who knows it starts right time the day when you are going and you miss it
anyway from here you can go to arku through roadways also
buses and taxis are available
if you want to see the views of hills of the valley then taking window seat towards the left side of the bogey would be appropriate
however it is fully passenger train but some bogeys are reserved for the packages of tourism department
passing through the farms when the train moves ahead amidst the bushes of coconut and palm then one does not feel the journey ahead
before the start of the hilly journey the major stops are shivalingapuram and kottavalsa moving little ahead of which the hill journey begins
kms long rail line in between vishakhapattanam and kirandoolwas built in in association with the government of japan which brings the iron ore from beladila mines of bastar to vishakhapattanam
from where it gets exported to japan by ships
therefore throughout the way you will get to see goods train empty and laden with iron stones
wherever you pass your sight on both the sides of the railway only greenery shows up
when the snaky road starts once after kottavalsa it does not end until arku
one has to pass through tunnels also on this way
there are more tunnels on this way till now some of which are also big tunnels that are longer than even metres
after getting out of each of tunnel you get different air and different view
the coldness of the air and landscape of the delta calm the body and heart
excitement keeps on throughout the journey about how will it will be ahead
it is half past ten oclock and the train has so far completed the journey of kms
now its speed is slowing
on peeping is seen board tyada height from the sea level metres
when we started we were at the sea level
in the cold wind of tyada everybody naturally forgets the humidity filled heat of vishakhapattanam
the facilities of trekking camping is there for tourists in tyada
if there is time there is huge borarguhal borra cave here
this lac years old huge cave and the white stones built in it can surprise anyone
the arrival of tourists started in this old cave when this rail line was expanded
geologist william king found about this cave in and studied it
the largeness of the cave is discovered only after entering inside it
inside you get to see several types of constructions built of calcium rocks
now it is upon you what you see in them
the arrangement of cave is in the hands of tourism department of andhra pradesh
if you are new then it would be apt to take guide
proper arrangement for entrance and exit is there inside it so that tourists do not face inconvinience
with the oncoming of railway line tourists have also started coming here
most of people planning to tour araku in one day get down at borra cave
completing the tour here they go through the roadways to see the views of araku which is kms away from here
if your ticket is upto araku then wait because ahead is simliguda which is the highest point of this journey
total of metres above the sea level
the highest railway station of broad gauge line in india
however after the start of the underconstruction railway line of kashmir its challenge will end
from simliguda the views of araku valley become visible from where the rail line starts lowering
seeing outside you find the currents of rail gosthani sometimes nearby while sometimes afar
afterall once again the train stops with bumping
upon asking we find that it is araku station halt
but nothing like platform is seen here
you can get down here as well as at araku station which is at distance of kms
the benefit of getting down at bazar halt is that you can plan here starting from lodging to tours
like every other place even here taximen and autorickshaw drivers surround you
along with the package of providing hotel to the tour packages
if you are expert at bargaining then you can save some money
if you know where you have to stay then there is no problem
you can find good and low budget hotels in the road from araku colony to railway station
you can see tribal dance here
araku is no big city
it is valley where the views of nature can be seen
araku valley is tribal area where more than tribes live
there is museum established by tribal development authority here so that people know about the tribes
glimpse of the living culture and traditions of the tribes residing in this region can seen in this museum
views of the rural life have been exhibited in the form of their models in it
its round construction is worth watching
the architect of the museum can be praised for the way things have been presented here
you can also get an experience of running the bows and arrows used by the tribal people here
facility of boating is also there in the complex
four kms away from araku bazaar and araku station spread in an area of hectares the padampur garden is such garden which was built by the british army for the supply of vegetables
later it was converted to botanical garden
the rishimukh built at the entrance causes curiosity
several varieties of flowers trees spices and herbs are grown in the gardens
for the education tours for the students of botany and gardening this is an ideal place
you can also travel through the toy train inside the garden
you can also buy handicrafts built of wax and wood by the tribal women
there are also few huts for the stay of tourists in the garden
by touring the tribal villages there in the araku valley you can see and know their living closely
the weekly market holding here is enough to cause curiosity in the new person
you can spend two to three hours here
the tourism of araku is at its peak from november to february
if you come in november you must keep warm clothes
it is rare that you wo nt get chance to see the shooting of film
there are many gardens in these hills
besides the duduma waterfall of machkund nearby araku valley two more big waterfalls are worth watching
sangda waterfall can also be toured
as souvenir of araku you can buy crafts built of bamboo wax and terracota and wood from the tribal handicraft shops built here
one can see how are the coffe gardens and how cardamom is grown by visiting the villages here
one travels to darjeeling shimla or ooty even today through narrow gauge but the journey to the hills of araku is of broad gauge
despite the speed of kms the journey of this train also creates thrill
vishakhapattanam is connected through air service with delhi hyderabad and chennai
in the same way direct rail service is available for vizag from the major cities of the country
all the major trains going north india to karnataka tamilnadu kerala pass throug vijaywada from where visakhapattanam is at distance of to hours
however one can come here by the north through jagdalpur koraput but this way is not so popular
one can reach here also through rail or roadways through koraput
tourists coming to bastar can come from jagdalpur through koraput
the roadways from bhuvaneshwar to koraput is also an option
this is extremely long but the beauty of the coastal region is known by coming through this way only
this road comes through the most naxalhit region of orissa
it takes to hours in the journey upto koraput but only few people gather the courage to come with it
if you have come to araku with an intention to picnic then it will be better that you see the important places here in day otherwise you can see the views nearby it while staying here comfortably
bikaner is one among the five major divisions of rajasthan and this has been an important division and district headquarter of western rajasthan since the time of the royalties
even today the people there remember maharaja gangasingh with great respect
he was the king who made bikaner garden in the second half of the twentieth century
at that time the treatment and medical equipments that were available they were no where in northwestern india
prince vijay singh was the eldest and favorite son of maharaja gangasingh
before time in the short age of youth he died due to some reason
people used to come to this place from faroff places for treatment in prince vijay singh memorial lrb rrb built in his memorial
the renowned doctors of rajasthan also studied there and gave their services also there such as late dr katju late dr kansal late dr sharda rao respectively of orthopaedics ophthalomolgy and gynaecology
these main doctors were renowned at that time
till now this city has not been connected with air services regularly
air service is sometimes started and sometimes stopped
however with the point of view of tourism there is so much to see here but tourists want fast reaching direct service which is not available
government wants to start fast train but ignoring the farsightedness of the government even petty local leader holding flag along with fiveten villagers start demanding for stopping train at every station
while the tourists want to reach bikaner in the least time sitting directly from delhi agra or jaipur
now some steps have been taken for the beautification of bikaner
leaving the roads of the boundry wall here lrb which now can not be widened rrb all the other remaining raods have been made fourlane
built in front of the famous junagarh fort is the historical sursagar which used to be pleasant place in the decades of fourties fifties sixties
in the cold wind of evening sitting on the squares of the stones built beside the water the elders used to talk play chess sing rammats later that became shallow and stinky place of dirty water
people passing through that area were compelled to cover their nose with cloth
since last thirty years there was no one to take care of this historical well
now its marshes have been cleaned
applying three borings in it clear clean beautiful water has been filled
beautifying the famous public park it has been made like flowers of spring
all around junagarh fort proper road arrangement and proper lighting arrangement have been made so that the fort looks beautiful even at night
it has been more than years since the settlement of bikaner
however by the administration its establishment day is celebrated on akhateej lrb akshay tritiya samvat april ad according to hindu calendar because date changes every year rrb
bikaner is of great importance with the point of view of historical and tourism
among the big feudal areas of rajasthan here the names of bikaner udaipur jodhpur and rawatsar are known because of mutual relationship
however the the royal family of deogarh also comes in the same sequence
no other areas got so much of historical aspect as these areas
its administration was more peaceful before the coming of the mughals and the british
during peace time only architecture and art rises
among the historical palaces lalgarh palace the fort of junagarh museum ganga theatre shri kollayatdham gajner palace and sanctuary husain sar national ushtra research centre the temple of karani mother of deshnok world renowned the havelis of ram purias the evening of sursagar are worth watching
in the past few years hotel business has emerged in bikaner
if you leave heritage hotels which are total of two or three the remaining hotels of international level local resorts three star hotels are opening up in big numbers
but everyone has to say the same thing that it will be difficult for us to work with thirty percent occupancy and there are also some problems
one is that electricity goes off very often and the level of water of bikaner has also gone very low
therefore the problem of water remains here
for the foreign tourists it is necessary for the transport medium to be fast and convinient to reach here
they have lot of money but less time
also there is no particular resource for local sightseeing
there is dearth of english speaking people
local guides do not know english properly and even if they speak mistakenly the pronunciation is never correct
given an opportunity or while talking with one another the foreigners laugh
the public hotel tourist bungalow is dhola maru which is in bad situation
there are many dharamshalas but they do not get the inspiration to stay in the dharamshalas
there are several places for touring in bikaner and nearby but they do not have appropriate publicity
if you consider all the points above then with the point of tourism bikaner can be given international status
working as assistant director in in the tourism department and cultural department bikaner of rajasthan tourism art and cultural hanuman mall says before coming to tourism gave my services in the air force as well
am an officer who works in planned way
the responsibility of the organization of camel festival being held here is on me
first time camel festival by our department was organised in bikaner was held for two days on january
it was new arrangements some laggards were there still they it was very succesfull
programmes were so much crammed that foreigners never got time off
this is fifth biggest tourist destination of rajasthan
we are also planning for desert safari
next year there is possibility of foreigner and national tourists coming here
on the organization of the camel festival for the first time it got so much of fame and next year there was no space in the hotels including dhola maru
then several hotels were built in bikaner
today the situation is that this year sixteenth fair was held this year
people are still praising its success
this is matter of pride for us
but yes agree that with the point of view of development since last several years at several levels many shortcomings have been there but several works have also been done with which the beautification of bikaner improved four folds
many people consider galle located on the southern tip of pearl like sri lanka mixed form of the beauty of goa and maldives
blue sea seems to be spread infinitely
the road from candy to galle reminds of goa
it is like going from madgaon to panaji
open flower laden homes like that of goa
construction also almost the same
large gardens of coconut and rubber
if you go ahead then you find greenery on side and emerging sea on the other side
people also look like our own country the same complexion pleasant and mixing in the same way
hats are held in the same way as ours
the way from candy to galle going ahead merges with colombo galle highway
this is totally beside indian ocean
candy is the heart of sri lanka both in beauty and geography
while galle is the tip of sri lanka both in beauty and geography
galle is located on the lowest tip of sri lanka little towards west
we indians know galle much for its cricket stadium
stadium is also very grand galle city on one side the galle fort just in front of pavellion and sea on the left side
the stadium of galle is among the good examples of the tsunami disaster in and the victory of human will after that
therefore it was very fine that reaching galle we got at first glimpse of the stadium
it was preparing itself for the test match starting two days later
standing below the colck tower of galle fort watching the stadium is very mesmerising
galle fort surrounded by the sea on three sides was settled under the control of portuguese and dutch
most of the buildings inside the fort show glimpse of hundreds of years old history
moving around here it seems as if we are touring an old european city
high gates big windows open courtyards construction of total european style in everything whether it is church or mosque or hotel or courts
walking on the wall of the fort from the clock tower there is different kind of romance in the going towards the light house watching on the one side the old city and on the other side the sea
the sea is deep just along the wall of the fort
this would have been the reason for building the fort
however at some places there are also ladders for getting down
on the way on the wall several local boys request the tourists to throw coins in the sea
behind the coins they also jump in the sea
the coins brought out from water becomes their prize
if you go to lin ban street while touring inside the old city of the dutch fort of gaul you will find an art gallery there
the building where this gallery is in is built in and it is considered one among the oldest buildings of the fort city
the building had turned into ruins
its present owner alhaj gaffar brought back its old grandeur mix of the same old sculpture color soil and pearl
the same kind of wood work
even well of that period in middle of the courtyard has been built again in the same way with lime stone and pearl by digging
but the most particular thing of this building is its museum
several rare and antique items of the period of the portuguese the british and the dutch have been collected here
it includes jewellery pottery coins weapons cameras chandeliers and god knows what
all of these things have been collected from different places and some of these are even goods brought by searching in the deep sea from the ships that sank long time ago
several things are really surprising and the most surprising is the fact that all this formalities are done by the same single person
all these priceless items kept safely in the almirahs attached all around in several rooms are his own wealth
items are so old and rare that estimating their price is also not possible
main city is very small
on both the sides of the city coming back from colombo and going ahead to matara or dondra is the grandest hotel of galle
if you move ahead from galle then on the side leaving tempobrain island and through mirisa one can reach matera
the star fort there is small but good specimen of dutch craft
fort is built in the shape of star
water is filled all around the fort and there is only one bridge to go there which also can be wrapped from the fort itself
this would have been less of fort and more of residence of the public officials or at most post
till now it was being watched by small crocodile which we found taking rest on rock in the water
if you move little more ahead from matera you will reach dondra head
this is the southern tip of sri lanka
the light house built here is one among the biggest light houses of sri lanka
watching the lagoons built along it one gets reminded of the lagoons of thiland
the sequence of the rocks break the waves of the sea and the water of lagoon remains calm
crashing with those rocks the angry waves get several metres high
many times this water creates extremely grand views
all the coasts present on this southernwestern tip of sri lanka are particularly popular with the tourists
this keeps on being the center of several activities throughout the year
just near the dondra head itself big statue of buddha also is counted as one among the highest statues of buddha of sri lanka
stay in galle and get out for some fun and frolic somewhere nearby
from here one can also go to meet the wild animals of yala
if you go to dondra from galle itself then whales and dolphins in the sea can be spotted
besides this if you wish bird watching can be done in bundala
you can go for tour in the jungles of hiare and kannelia
nature walk can be done in kottawa and rumassala
till koggala or ginganga one can tour on boats
water sports can also be enjoyed at different beaches like haikaduwa or bentota
near haikaduwa there are extremely grand coral reefs for which tourists come to see through diving
when we came to sit in the balcony of the hotel then we got to see the sea waving in the front
this was so much to get touched
you can experience the warmth of the water oozing out
one gets to see the beauty of the sea here
due to this it is considered to be competition of maldives
all the hotels that are there on the highway from colombo to galle are towards the sea
starting from the taj sea towards the lighthouse and fortress many of the grandest hotels of sri lanka are beside the indian ocean
one tip of all these hotels keep on playing with the waves continuously
it is obvious that its swimming pools also touch the sea water
that is if you are in the pool you will never know when the pool ended and where the sea started
this is the concept of the andeles swimming pool
but one more important thing about this part of sri lanka which is not visible anywhere else in the world is the stilt fisherman of galle those fishermen who catch fish sitting on the bamboo standing in the sea
these fishermen keep on sitting on this bamboo at sunrise and then at the sunset for hours so that some big fish is caught in the hook
this has been an old tradition of the fishermen community of this area
however when and how it started no body knows it for sure
some people say that after the second world war some fishermen used this method for the first time which became part of tradition
its number had started dwindling after the tsunami that came five years ago
in an attempt to keep the tradition alive these people have started becoming visible again
this formality of catching the fish holding hook in the hand sitting on this unusual bamboo in the crazy sea seems to be surprising
in the morning when we started to walk beside the sea behind the hotel the first glimpse of these fishermen was surprising
the comfort with which he was smoking bidi taking it out from his bag see this suddenly it was unbelievable because they were at some distance in water
how many fish they would have been able to catch and how much that would cater to their and their family needs it was not very difficult to estimate it
but taking even so much of pains they have kept the tradition alive
families of such fishermen are said to reside in galle and nearby areas specially in the kathaluwa and ahangama settlements
this is just family business which keeps on getting inherited by one generation to the other
but now this is also big attraction for the tourists
sri lanka has been considered as one among the most excellent places for spotting baleen whale
due to being affected with the civil war for last several years the tourists have been deprived of this opportunity but now the atmosphere is calm
every year the time from november to april has been considered to be the most appropriate
the eastern coast of sri lanka is the most suitable
these months the whales go from the southern tip towards the bay of bengal
most of the activities take place in the months of decemebr and janury
the sea is also comparatively calm during these days
whales are seen nearby the coast
at the same time these whales go towards maldives in the west
the density of type of whale in the sri lankan sea is one among the most
the biggest mammal of the world blue whale is here
this can be upto metres long and can reach upto hundred tonnes in weight
then fin whale humpback whale mink whale etc area also there
besides the whale the number of spinner dolphins is also good here
these can be spotten on the southeastern coast of yala from the gulf of mannar to trincomalee
several researches have been conducted about the intelligence of whales their voice their food behavior etc
interesting facts are known through these about different types of whales
watching them with one own eyes is rare experience
well known wildlife photographer of sri lanka gehan disilva vijeratne says that watching blue and sperm whale between mirisa and dondra head in sri lanka is easier than watching panther in yala
dondra head is the southern most tip of sri lanka
if you there from galle then mirisa falls in between
that is if you make galle your base the you plan for whale tour
if the young generation of country start making such travels then probably there would be no doubt in the predictions of the former president abdul kalam vision getting realized

if understood tiredness is mental state but for entourage one needs both money and time together
so when we got both then the himachali residents like us spent some time away in the greenblue watery complex of port blair the capital of andaman nicobar
it was exactly like keralite did some vagabondery in the high mountains of kinnour
chandigarh airport is in renovation grip
after security checking the space for sitting particualry during the takeoff time seemed falling short
use of tractor might be decreasing in lessenning farming but is used much here in pulling luggage
seeing the security we felt that if such security is everywhere then life would be like clear water
flight was that of the private company but was late
there can be several mediums to reach anywhere
to reach port blair it is necessary to board either ship or aeroplane from chennai vishakhapattanam or kolkata
it takes about two hours in the air journey of kms from chennai
the journey through ship is between to hours
when we reached chennai saying vannakam welcome then the airport was pensive
the flight was of four and half oclock in the morning
night was to be spent drinking teacoffe and dozing
weather adverse to that of north india flocks of mosquitoes and tasteless tea for thirty rupees
since three and half hours in the morning the counter of the private airlines was welcoming with flower bouquets
when we flew for port blair it was dark
as we reached near it light started dawning
in lap of clouds sitting on the seats of the aeroplane it feels as if we are not flying rather passing through the peels of borax
kalapani was also mentioned on the way
when we reached the hotel the daffodil flowers kept in water inside round pot of brass welcomed us
it was necessary to eat after some rest
in the style of eat of the place where you go we ate tasty food in vegetarian annapurna and got ready for vagabondship
woman runs this house and she maintained taste and credibility
so till return we did not change the place of eating
national memorial and art gallery reminds of several events like the andaman journey of subhas chandra bose and lahore conspiracy
the gallery paintings of several famous painters
its main theme is british cruelty freedom and struggle
from here we reach the historical jail of kalapani
now it has the hustle and bustle of tourists
walking in the cellulor jail our generation enslaved by conviniences can not understand how our freedom fighters bore the inhuman cruelties of the british yet never let the desire of freedom lessen
the mark of the administrative and clever mind of the british shows clearly while watching the jail complex
hundreds of the thirteen and half by eight feet wide cells are now silent
moving here one gets to easily feel the price of freedom
there is also photo gallery here
there are pictures speaking of forgotten historical events in it
there are trees of coconut and betel nut in the complex of the jail
three side open sea is also here
it helps make the jail journey of the tourists easy
in the evening sound and light show is organised in the complex of the jail
as there was some time for presentation so we came through the sea shore
here sea moves all around in each of the streets and colonies
there thousands of such places where sands are scattered with several shades of rainbow
water with god knows how much of depth innumerous colors and heights keep on kissing it with its waves throughout the life
even straight bent and fallen coconut trees also form unique views
there is not that much of the crowd of tourists on these seashores spread on the lap of uneven ground
for the local people this seashore is an appropriate place to sell cocnut water
we also tasted jhalmuri
it is time for light and sound show
tourists are entering
show is at first in hindi then in english
the expert stage voices like that of manohar singh ompuri tom alter made the cruel events of the revolution time heart touching
this union of light and sound is capable of inspiring anyone to be patriot
but despite forbidding people kept on recordinig mobiles kept on ringing whispering kept on until they were not forbidden
it seemed that patriotism now became entertainment
next morning tickets to go to nile island were booked
we had to board the ship in the morning
watching the sea it does not feel that there are also mountains on the earth
to reach the islands there are also speed boat and boats for small journeys besides government ships
ship ride was safe
seeing the life jacket after being seated arouses the feeling of safety
but only those stay at the seats who commute everyday
tourists go on the deck and even above that where ever possible
they either honestly imbibe the frolicking waves of the sea or capture them in the pictures
we reached nile island famous for its immense beauty
having written my on white paper viplav was waiting for me there
our hearts blossomed to see all this at such distant place
daughter started saying what welcome
quenching hunger is more necessary than watching beauty
lean and thin straight fields of taller trees of coconut and betel nuts are here
more trees than men about fourty five hundred
laccha parantha in the hotcase along with coconut sauce and vegetable of dry beans
our appetite increased as we saw food
mishti doi doubled our joy
we also saw signboards of indian continental israeli seafood
there were very few people on the sea shore
transparent blue nectar playing near clear shining sand
with calm water you can be friendly as much as you want you can enjoy it as much as you want
we saw elder tourists here enjoying comfortably neck deep in water for long
people enjoying the magnificent expanse of the sea keep on lying under the trees for hours
there are more beaches in nile but the seashore of bharatpur is incomparable
we went to the other shores also
looking at photographs on returning it seems what waves they were
we were introduced to the unique world of corals of various kinds some feet underneath deep sea through glass on the plastic boat in sea on the neel island
the thrill loving tourists also get to do snorkelling under the guidance of experienced guides to experience corals and sea life up close on many shores
coconuts were so many that the need for water was not felt
the water of reddish brown coconut is more sweet
if the green coconut on tree grows more in size it will taste like coca cola it also felt so on drinking
in the ordinary green coconut sweetness and taste is ordinary
if grape pulp has to be eaten then spoon made of coconut will soon be presented
health and pleasure both thirst is quenched as well
it is possible to stay overnight at neel but we had to return after noon
on return journey we touched havelock island
there are comfortable overnight stays here also
after deboarding the passengers and boarding letters at havelock island when the ship moved towards port blair then the colors of evening were descending down on the water
the moving breeze changed the gait of waves after rain stopped
the breeze was coming from the front
waves troubled the ship moved slightly up and down
in such situation many tourists feel headache lrb sea sickness rrb
if standing on deck then water drowning in deep colors fills every bit of you with fear filled thrill
neel to port blair via havelock takes more than four hours
in this ship staff canteen was also not open here we realized how important is tea
now under navy at some time acting as the capital for the british and japanese ross island is neighbor of port blair
next day journey took us on trip to three islands but we had to visit only the ross
while going the island which is seen towards left is north bay

and also dismayed peeping deers peacocks swamp deer
they are captured in the present of this place
one goes to the beach named ferrar of ross by descending down several stairs
here water seemed to be angry here also coconut water remained as the energy source
when rain came then we reached at the jetty hurriedly
we had to go to badoor after noon
the greenery of farms on both sides of the road and flowers blossomed here and there made the journey convivial
the devastated households on both the sides made us understand that tsunami effect was still here
the sand of this shore is coarse wherein aquatic plant saawla is spread
they look like soft plastic
the sea here was angry
the whole ambience was fragrant by the scented plants of black pepper clove mace cinnamon betel nut
in the neighborhood shop here ornaments and other creative products made of pearls and other aquatic gifts are available
they are sold at expensive prices in city showrooms
also saw conch made lampshades soop walls bangles and rings during the market visit in the evening
had to fly back in the morning
heart wanted to stay there for sometime but mind was talking about returning to work
the air hostess was telling us with what security measures the aircraft is equipped with

the mutual identity of south india is either made of its temples or of the sea surrounding it from three sides whose two ends meet at kanyakumari but in this counting we usually forget its enormous and grand forest resource
to forget forests is actually form of human gratitude equivalent to turn our faces away from our life eternal source
forest is the life source of that concrete urban civilization on which our feet are stabilised but our tragedy is that we don have time to even think about it
believe that if you have not felt the fragrance of forest then probably you have not lived your life completely
more than at all other places this point is naturally understood while passing through its enormous forests
these forests filled with wild flowers fruits birds and other animals are so dense that till some time before dacoit veerappan had remained invisible for many years under its shadow
sandalwood trees sources of numerous sandalwood trees and many spices related our daily life plants of tea coffee are spread over in its depth
you will get filled with the feeling of miracle towards that unique creation of virat while touching the leaves on its long pathways and drawing its palpating breaths inside yourself
if this nature is an extension of god then however abstract its worldly existence might be you can see its tangible and direct form in front of your eyes in the heart beat of its forests
periyar sanctuary in the ilaychi pradesh of kerala is in the most important national forests of this country and spread around periyar lake its wide area of square kilometres can be the root of journey spanning many days
there are also two ways to reach periyar but we chose the road way of kms from kottayam railway station
this way going through kerala kanjirapalli city gradually climbs up the mountains covered with tea plantations
besides its nilgiri tea this state is also world famous for coffee and cardamom plantations
little ahead when we traveled through peermed village then near the road beautiful waterfall was falling from the mountain
little while before thekdi village worldly circumstances restricted us on the way
we got to know that all the employees of tea plantations were sitting on strike against their employers
among them women had large number and they along with men were standing blocking the way
due to thousand of strikers traffic was blocked group of policemen were watching spectacle with helpless look on their face
we also vehicles kept waiting with all other for the strike to break
an acquaintance expressing sympathy towards the strike told us that these plantations are very old and after years of exploitation its employees have become member of big co operative organization
near periyar is village kumili and adjacent to it on the border of periyar national park is spread the territory of thekdi where we had set up provision for our stay
right in the center of periyar is lake around which is spread dense forest
during summers when water of all places dry then this lake becomes the only way for animals to quench their thirst
seeing the importance of this lake in forest british colonel panikick suggested dam for periyar river to increase water and under the supervision of the king of travankor this dam was made in due to which the area of periyar lake increased to km square
due to dam portion of forest did immerse in water but attracted by the rich water of the reservoir many animals started to come towards this forest
besides elephants tigers and other animals were also among them
later on it was changed into national park
due to increase in the size of the lake the trees which immersed in water stubs of some of them are visible above water even today and thousands of birds stay on them
thekdi village and kumili village nearby have now adapted themselves as per the needs of local and foreign tourists
small big hotels tea shops restaurants and spice shops have grown here
there was the empire of greenery till far outside our hut like cottage standing near the forest
golden oriole sitting on the tree in grove seems to be trying to say something in its melodious voice
speaking in sweet voice this long familiar bird name is boukathakou meaning daughter say the story
many fragrant varieties of wild flowers can be seen grown here and there

on the new land discovered by christopher columbus in the fifteenth century tourists come all year long to jamaica to see the beauty of blue mountain torrid zonal natural scenes babbling rivers while flowing and roaring waterfalls
tourists are overwhelmed by its limitless resources
the total area of this long and wide country situated in caribbean sea is square
rivers flow here passing through the beautiful mountains
having torrid zonal climate the weather here is always hot
its population is lakh
of them are of the african origin and the remaining are of lebanese chinese indian spanish and french origin
majority of the people speak patois made up of mixture of african french spanish and english language
the official language here is english
along with the christian majority some hindu muslim and bahai religious followers are also here
from many past centuries intercaste marriages or between different races have been happening
due to all this the society here has become of different races meaning of diverse physical structure
christopher columbus the discoverer of america found this island in caribbean sea in
in its northern area in the bay of st anne he arrived on th may for the first time
the area where columbus arrived spain has taken some portion of it under its reign
this part name was jamaica
in local language it is called as the land of waterfalls or land of forest and water
in the arrival of the people of spain began
occupying many other parts they made their administrative capital in jago de la vega in
from th century to spanish and british rulers have reigned in spain
in the midst of this the british concentrated more on the farming of sugarcane and established many sugar industries
the increasing demand of labourers in sugar industry gave an opportunity for bonded labor and slavery to flourish
considering the lack of labors more than lakh labourers were imported from africa
many of them were sent to other places in america
during the th and th centuries these slaves revolted many times
as result of this the british government liberated more than lakh labourers in jamaica on august
with the liberation of large number of salves there was scarcity of labourers in sugar industry
this is why the british thought of bringing inexpensive labourers from india
on th may first indian diasporic labourer parmeshwar stepped on the jamaican land
indian labourers were sent to jamaica from on contract basis to work in the sugar industry
in this near labourers returned back on the completion of the contract
right now there are more than people of indian origin
they have adjusted completely in the social milieu there
how influential are the people of indian origin there
it could also be guessed from this fact that the indians have even reached the post of the judge of the supreme court there
people of indian origin are doctor pathologist professor and chartered accountant in large numbers here
large number of people here in jewellery and electronics business are from sindhi community
in jamaica there are many such indian groups who keep high affinity level towards cultural programs and indian cuisine
the clue to this point is the organization of roti festival since
besides the capital kingston in cities like ocho rioz negril montago bay there are many plazas of indians
due to hard work professional specialisation and rich cultural heritage indians have lot of respect in jamaica
however during this period due to spending long time in this country and marrying people of other race staying here many people of indian origin have lost their indian identity
despite all this even today not only indian festivals like holi and diwali are celebrated there in fact they also keep an affection for indian cuisine
besides abundant natural beauty water sports jerk meat reggae music and blue mountain are the center of attraction at an international level
tourists from all over the world come to jamaica to see them
especially its jerk meat is famous all over the world
ackee is jamaica national fruit
local people eat this with salty fish with great relish
outside their own country jamaica residents greatly feel the absence of this fruit
if it was said that without this friend they wouldn want to stay at any other place then it wouldn be an exaggeration
ackee ripe fruit is very tasty
however despite so many specialities this fruit also has bitter side to it that is its raw fruit is poisonous
in the eastern part of this island high majestic blue mountain seems like its touching the sky
beautiful natural shores like cities of montego bay ocho rios port antonio and negril are the special center of attraction for tourists
attraction for this island among tourists can be inferred from this fact as well
where the total population here is lakh the number of tourists coming here every year is way more than that meaning even more than lakhs
more than lakh tourists come from america alone
in the year jamaica earned lakh american dollars from tourists
situated in the north eastern part montago bay is the second big city of jamaica
it is also known as the tourist capital of jamaica

it is famous till australia england and japan
researchers from across different countries come here for research
it is true in the context of extremely poor but talented bihar
bihar shabby in present times has treasure of historical archaeological and religious heritage
even though for the past two decades bihar nawada district identity has been formed by the massacres in the fight of brawny godfathers for domination
the truth is that in the soil here not only solid proof of histories of various periods are buried but the art heritage of magadha bang meaning pal sen which arose in bengal and bihar between th to th century
statues found in the land of the districts sonubigha madra marui samay sisvan koshla patwa sarai maharaawaan bermi narhat and makanpur which are adorning the narada museum are not just very ancient but also present an amazing specimen of art
due to this it is being considered as the main center for collection and research of the remains of magadh bang or pal sen art genre
the genre of this very art was later named as eastern school of art
narada museum situated at nawada crossing at around km far from patna is today center of attraction for national and international tourists and researchers due to its unparallel collection of rare ancient sculptures manuscripts weapons and tools art works and coins

obtained from haraahi of vazeerganj of gaya idol of hindu goddess kankali padyapaani avalikiteswar obtained from kurkihar buddhist goddess hariti obtained from dhuriyanwa and idol of hindu manjushri are extraordinary
dr singh told us that the description of independent existence of eastern school of art can be found in taranaath
it has been said in taranath that during the reign of pala rulers devpal and dharampal dhiman and his son vritpal made many idols
in the inscriptions of salimpur there is discussion of famous sculptor someshwar
it is clear that in magadh sculpture art was very rich
the idol of sun found in bermi of nawada district has shoes in its feet
it is belief that looking at sun foot brings bad omen therefore shoes have been worn in the feet
head of bihar magahi board ram ratan prasad ratnaakar says that the research on eastern school of art done till now is incomplete till the time the study of idols of naarad museum is not complete
due to these reasons narada museum situated in the middle of nawada district is said to be the representative museum for magadh bang genre
under the guidance of indian archaeological survey ex director dr amrendra nath dozen researchers have researched on sculpture science here
he said that this is amongst the major museums in india not only in bihar
this museum gives and opportunity for serial development studies

history academician dr rajeev ranjan from nalanda university situated in biharsharif says that the time of pal was the golden era in the development of gaya nawada and nalanda
in kurkihar and around sculptors used to make sculptures in large numbers
this is the reason that in this area idols related to vaishnav shaiv buddhist and hindu religion are found
even though naarad museum is known for its collection of very ancient art works coins manuscripts weapons and tools but it is young itself
district officer narendra pal singh established it in tin shed in
he collected ancient sculptures and other objects scattered at nawada and nearby areas

good crowd was gathered around parks at beaches and the opera house decorated with petals
the attraction to see from height cruises ferry boats yachts playing in the sea climbed on the bridge
came to darwin in the afternoon of rd april
when came from south dull cloudy winters to darwin blinding light then clothes seemed intolerable
darwin looked like the indian town in the hot jeth month
my reservation was in the tourist house
after freshening up went straight to beufort center the spot for world conference
when met the organiser robert baidranik then he told me that proposed tours pre conference have been suspended
therefore no need to go to papua new guinea
yes after the conference grand tour of kakadu area has been scheduled
reservation needs to be done for that
that very evening met george chapluka cave art specialist in the art science museum the northern territory who was also the chairman of world conference
he was also the manager of our grand tour
requested him to include kakadu in the tour
after river tour seeing cave art of el seraana and going through pine creek road we people came to indith shore for night stay
this was the most beautiful spot till now
around the lake made of huge waterfall was complete reign of nature except the camping arrangement
after putting mosquito net on the land with the support of bushes we took short nap
bathed in the lake
then got busy in cooking food
from the fragrance of spices and seasoning everyone would come to know that indian dishes are about to be prepared
from indithfall we people headed towards kathreen via victoria highway
that day saw cave art of ingelaadi
spent the night there only next day saw illustrated shilashray of jarlitvaug and victoria river
night stay was in victoria inn on september got inclined towards the timber creek and saw the cave art of boormiyiniung and revolver spring
after spending the night in the kip river national park we went to the nearby rockbed the next day then we went to the art center of kutrunura
in this trip of kakadu area to see meter high ant hills of termites was an unforgettable experience for us
the vegetative fact that we could lay our hands on was the adverse effects of eucalyptus and safeda
australia is the home of white lead where its species can be found
trees of some species out of these are as high as metres
the wood of jaara species is the hardest
the shape of some trees are like banyan jamun neem and tun trees
in areas abundant in safeda complete scarcity of birds and animal was visible despite that in australia mammals of kinds same number of kinds of lizards snakes of kinds tortoise of one and half dozen variety and many kinds of fishes are found
all these creatures are found in fertile areas only
the white area looks like desert
although three fourth australia is dry today and the entire population stays in the plains of beach area but in the past australia was far more succulent as it is known from the huge dried ponds and skeletons
during the stay in australia met indians in darwin one evening also who had invited us on dinner
we also saw crocodile farm one day
on the name of wild animals these aquatic devils have kingdom on the water resources of australia
before leaving australia we people had bought copies of tribal monthly paper land rights news
first of all on the front page australia in black red divided in these two strips and an orange scorching sun in the middle were shown
it is the symbol of tribal flag
below at one side was black australia painted and on the other side was completely white australia which was denounced
in the newspaper news about the still prevailing bias and suppression were published
one black sister had exposed the colonial suppression in her autobiography titled my story
another black brother had made film by the name of white man wherein the european civilisation was torn to pieces
on this diwali holidays went to barman ghaat
it is beautiful pilgrimage situated at the shore of narmada
one day taking local friend along set out to visit villages nearby
in one village there was an ancient chateau of some gaund king
started sketching the village after climbing on that
saw that villager was looking at me with doubtful eyes
he left after while
we got down on the completion of the sketch
had just reached the border of the village when saw man with stick walking swiftly towards us
huge crowd had gathered outside the house of malgujaar
that villager was also among them
giving an explanation said am an artist
am an art teacher
have hobby of writing also
during holidays leave to roam on the shores of narmada
make pictures of narmada life
finally one day departed for putlikhoh with that friend of mine
took an informant along
sometimes through mountains or forests at times through the sorghum millet farms then at times through the high edges of narmada we reached kerpaani in the evening
on reaching there we came to know that putlikhoh is kms far from here
we had come walking around kms
we were tired and hunger was also troubling us
but the attraction of putlikhoh was so strong that we left on an empty stomach with local informant along
putlikhoh is in such an inaccessible area that if we had bothered about food then we would not have been able to see it
mountain waterfall has made its way through two mountains
putlikhoh is in this waterfall and the way to reach it is also this waterfall
this waterfall has become narrow ahead
standing edges on both the sides
going through the huge flagstones from the side of the picturesque waterfalls
here it flows between entirely flat rocks
throughout the year cold clear water stays here
on one side of the waterfall is meter high standing edge
this is putlikhoh
dampened my handkerchief from the water of the waterfall
then kept looking at the horizontal layered rocks of standing edge
then started caressing the rocks with the wet handkerchief
kept looking in awe
at one place after the rock was wet many figures started to emerge
when saw it from close my happiness knew no bounds
they were rock paintings made some years before from today
due to sun rain and air they have faded but when wet cloth is caressed over it then they are visible again
these pictures are made on horizontal layers of rocks
the width of the layer is eight or nine inches
this is why the height of pictures is six or seven inches
all pictures are made of light red ochre color
in rock art usually animal warrior or prey is registered
the atmosphere here is different
holding each other hands human figures are either dancing or going somewhere
at one place more than figures have been registered in one line only
such simple lively and natural illustration of dance festival in the form of panel will probably be found elsewhere
figures are of two kinds obese and emaciated
the caravan of obese figures is going somewhere one behind the other
people think of it as an army here
the shape of emaciated figures is like damru
they have held each other hand
they seem like dancing
unfortunately due to the water leaking from the rocks at the top the heads of all figures have faded
designed some figures
it was getting dark so we returned
went again in the morning
chitronvali edge had bathed in the sun
made some more imitations
most pictures are usually at height of or metres and this is why can be seen easily
after looking at them to our heart fill we set to return back to burman ghaat
was thinking that the number of samples of prehistoric art that can be found in madhya pradesh are nowhere else
exciting point is that all these places are either in narmada valley or near narmada
putlikhoh is only kms away from narmada

zanskar situated in northwestern himalaya is the most parched and cold state of the country
this terrain spread over approximately thousand square metres is surrounded by kashmir in the north west lahol in the south tibet in the east and kishtwar in the west
two world famous himalayan peaks nun and kun are existent in this state
for this reason apart from natural beauty buddhist caves and ancient culture this area is prime example of mountaineering also
in the winter season due to excessive snowfall the zanskar area becomes very cold impassable and absolutely like desolate
before being the rule of the rulers of dogra of jammu kashmir in zanskar was an independent state within ladakh
zanskar area also kept being known by the name of little tibet
the villages of zanskar state are situated primarily in the valleys of two major rivers doda and lingti and their tributaries
there is clear effect of the geographical location and climate of this place on the places chosen for establishing villages clothing of men and women religious festivals worshipping practises of gods and goddesses and ceremonial conventions
the social and religious lives of people is regulated by the worship of temples
genteel art and cultural
the means of life maintenance in doda and lingti village is extremely limited
the art tradition of these villages seems to have been started in the first millennium by local animaltenders
the remnants of art in certain places in the impassive roads are existent in the form of those rocks on which the pictures of reindeer deer group dances chase scenes horses etc have been etched
on the advent and spread of the buddhist religion the major topic of this art tradition and buddhists monks and local
undoubtedly the ruins of the above mentioned art on the inaccessible roads are proof of the fact that in ancient times spread and expansion of buddhist religion and culture in tibet and central asia would have taken place through the medium of this very period
there is important contribution of this art tradition on local development also
apart from this its clear influence has fallen on the economic and cultural sides of danda and ligli villages
along with the spread of the buddhist religion in the kushan age the indian styles of art rose at mathura and gandhar
apart from the preexistent art of this place the influence of mathura and gandhar styles can also be seen on buddhist art
these art patterns are seen carved on the large stones in the maitrey and statues of the dhyani buddhist creed located at several places like karshekhar vyamakhar sumdhung sani phe tonde jangla muni etc
the religious significance of these places was continuously maintained and later in about the th th century inspired by the tibetan buddhist tradition many caves were constructed
in this art great tibetan scholar teacher rinchen gumpo in this area along with the construction of monasteries and temples made collection of incantations and tantric books
the most ancient and attractive buddhist cave constructed by guru rinchen gumpo is situated in samuda
constructed in approximately the th century the dukhang of this cave is considered unexcelled for its unique and attractive decoration
in it on the branches of the tree constructed in lhasa and five meditating buddhas are displayed in an impressive manner
the monasteries and temples of samuda hold similarity to the buddhist temples of alvi in structure and design
to reach here one has to come via alvi and according to an adage guru rinchen gumpo had reached samuda by that route only
jankhul cave is situated approximately east from padam on padam kishtwar road
this is famous in the entire region for its unparalleled art works and wondrous incidents
according to tradition it is believed that in the th century the maximum part of ladakh had got flooded
at that time guru naropa had sat at this stone and done deep meditation
his footsteps are still present on the stone
in approximately th century the construction of five storey temple was done adjoining that stone which goes upward gradually along with the height of the stone
in the fourth floor is that part of the stone on which are drawn the foot signs of guru naropa
in spite of its natural architecture also this cave of jankhul lends vivacity to its lonely atmosphere
the walls of the cave are painted with buddhist gods and goddesses and incidents
here in the pujas the famous gurus of ladakh tibet zenskar and bhutan temple constructors painters and rare idols of the composers of buddhist works have been kept
among these the statues of guru rinchanjangpo fyagaspa sherap and chherring dorje have their own unique attraction and importance
the buddhist memorial of sani approximately at distance of from padam is famous for its art
on the rock slabs located in the middle of the village the statues of maitrey buddha and awalokiteshwar have been sculpted
they are worshipped even today
in the indian art styles in these idols the coordination of mathura and gandhar is seen
apart from these idols the world famous kanika chorten of sani attracts everybody by its shape and architecture
otherwise the establishment of this stupa has been linked to the rule of kanishka but on the basis of architecture this can not be thought to be before the th th century
an idol of guru naropa is installed in the miniature temple attached with the stupa
small cells of another ancient temple located in the side of the temple has been decorated with the statues of buddhist deities and walls have been painted with the life events of padmasambhav
it seems by these pictures that their artists must have stayed in kashmir gate because picturesque description of kashmir has been done in the background of the pictures
in the buddhist temple of sani grand idol of buddha of gold is placed
in the th th century it had been made into two parts by dacoits but they stole away only the lower heavy part and left the upper part here itself
today the same upper part has been joined with the lower part constructed by stacko and the entire idol been kept in the temple
the temple constructed on the summit of the mountain situated in fey village is also considered to be of the time of rinchen zangpo
the most important attraction of this temple of fey village are the soulful depiction of incidents of the life of buddha
in these the sight of the head shaving of buddha has become very poignant
these wall paintings have been made by master fyagaspa sarop
sir aurel steine in his book ancient khotan has given the details of keshmundan pictures of buddha and according to him it has glimpse of the indian gandhar style of the fourth fifth century
apart from this coordination of the arts of kashmir indian middle asian and tibet is also found to be seen in the pictures in this temple
ancient relics are existent in the karsa village situated on the mountain in front of padam
apart from the remains of the forts in karsa village are some buddhist temples
these frescos of the temples of karsa village seem to be of the time of rinchen zangpo
five meditating buddhas are painted on the walls of the chortens situated in karsa village
the present cave of karsa is the biggest most important and valuable cave
there is adequate arrangement for staying of approximately lamas in the present cave of karsa
after the th century the monasteries temples of ladakh and zenskar had to go through the phase of external attacks by which lot of damage was caused to them
in this time dacoits took away innumerable rare idols and only some important buddhist temples remained
during this dacoity all monasteries temples and houses of kargil suru sod batalik and chigtan area got destroyed
most monasteries temples of zenskar were saved because of the impassable and safe geographical location
the invaders could not proceed beyond parkacha
after the th th century the maximum influence of tibetan architecture and worshipping practices was felt on the buddhist tradition of zenskar whose imprint can be seen seen in the monasteries and temples make at that time
apart from this from the point of view of safety also most monasteries temples of aslam had been made on the summits of mountains
lohsar the festival of new year celebrated in the winters fills them with such enthusiasm that they forget the chilling cold of also
but because of financial pressure modern tourism and the impractical policies of development the tradition of preservation of an ancient culture and buddhist memorials is going on being affected
after the severe struggles of the entire day after dealing with the dinner washing these mothers knitting carpets for so long could laugh wildly and could happily answer our every question
it is apparent in all these journeys the mention of kaddali festival used to come in now and then
we had promised many families that no matter what happens we would come to chaudans at the time of kaddali
elders used to bless that badwa shyangshe keep you safe this earth will definitely call you no matter what happens
now we had small daughter sunanda also who had just celebrated her second birthday
we were concerned about her health but we had to participate in this joyfulness of shauka samaj that shauka samaj which was like our second family
in dharchula our beloved and respected shri jawahar singh nabiyal and shri harish rautela used to continuously make available to us through letters every small and big information
kaddali mahotsav was to happen in october which was coming after gap of twelve years
in dharchula nabiyalji and rautelaji had with great intimacy cared for us three like always
on the left side of the entrance door of the great camp of juna akhara there is great crowd
small banner is saying that this is the place of urdhvabahu baba
an emaciated digambar elder baba is sitting to one side of the dhuni
some foreign girls were serving urdhvabahu baba
on the spread feet of urdhvabahu baba common indians are repeatedly touching their heads in respect
the right hand of urdhvabahu baba is constantly upright in blessing
with the left hand urdhvabahu baba is applying ash on the foreheads of the troubled indians and beating their troubles
it is half past eleven at night when am returning to media camp from the world of akharas based on ganga
outside the entrance doors of the akharas the group of band people are rehearsing for the procession of the royal bath of tomorrow morning
the whole kumbh city is bathed in the dazzle of light
here it does not seem that there is heavy crisis of electricity in the state
continuous electricity is being given to the kumbh by cutting from industries offices cities
on crossing pantun bridge heavy crowd of people sleeping waking on the sand lying twisted
the crowd is awaiting the break of dawn when the sun will enter the capricorn constellation and they will take dip in the sangam
there is such impatient such thrilling such heated wait for this moment by them that the dripping dew from above and the wet sand from below also does not produce any chill
am shivering despite the warmth of walking on foot only
it is very cold but had good sleep inside the swiss cottage of the media camp
friends woke me up at clock then the roaming lrb both of the body and mind rrb tiredness of the previous day was filled in my body
but had to get up and walk towards the shore of the sangam
today is makar sakranti the first royal bath of the kumbh
from five oclock various processions of akharas will leave for bath at the sangam
before this had gone for the kumbh of haridwar lrb rrb but this would be the first opportunity of seeing the royal bath
at half past four we were outside the media camp
the crowd of bathers was going on the red road long homogeneous affair of men women
some people had bags in their hands and some had goods filled gunny bags on their heads
some had held the hands of children tightly and some had held small kids
people are going continuously taking long steps murmuring something or the other
standing in wonder in front of the camp we were listening to snippets of all the languages of india so many languages
some were laughing and joking some were scolding their group and some were going along singing hymns
we also gel in this crowd it is just dusk now and we also met with lot of people coming back after makar sankranti bath
it seems that after midnight only the bathing had begun
the actual shore of the sangam remains reserved for the akhara of royal bath so those who have to bathe at the sangam nose they bathe at two three at night itself
people coming after bathing are very satisfied and are watching the crowd going for bathing with pride
seeing their satisfied walk the people going for bath get even more impatient
the footsteps of the people going for bath becomes quicker
hurry and worry surround them
there was so much crowd that fear started
stampede and accidents are not uncommon for kumbh
on the expanse of the sangam shore appearing ahead its as if the whole of india spreads out in front of the eyes
there is hardly any corner of the country from where the people have not come to this kumbh
people all around
going on bathing
come after bathing
lay down sat up
got their heads shaved
did libation
cooked food
ate meals
rolled at the feet of priests
searched for lost ones
cried
opened the bundle of difficulties
searched for moksha in the waters of the sangam
people are bumping into one another
they have no relation within themselves
they are not even recognizing each other voices
but today here in this kumbh they are in strange way looking one
this kumbh this ganga yamuna this makar sakranti
they are joined in one string
they have made large country
this is india
am being emotional
is any wave soaking me too in the kumbh
but what am seeing is the truth
this truth is in front of me
lucknow delhi mumbai kolkata is not india
allahabad is not india
but this kumbh is india
this is not just crowd
the dawn is receding
the first feel of the light fills these people with even more commotion
dawn was breaking
the capricorn constellation is about to welcome the sun
simultaneously collective hail resonates in the ears har har mahadev har har gange
in the camps across the ganga the arriving of the akharas had begun
the random tunes of the band have begun to get louder like noise
the zeal is increasing in the media people spread out here and there on the sangam shore
the policemen have become energetic
the fair authorities commissioner and proceed towards the pantun bridge with flower garlands
they have to do formal welcome of the arenas
we wanted to tear the crowd and reach the corner of the procession road
for the blessed returns of seeing the royal processions of the arenas the public is sitting stuck to each other since midnight
it is very difficult to cross this crowd mutually stuck with belief
seeing the procession of the hermits the crowd is emotional
again and again they are folding hands
respect is oozing in their eyes
their faces is shining in blessed manner
when they cry the slogans of hail mahadev hail ganga then automatically would get up half from their seats
these are destitute people
this is the indian middle class
they are always behind railing brims and barricading like they are at this time imprisoned behind the fences fixed on the procession road
but they are blessed from there
one procession has passed
the second one will come when this will have bathed
in the midst of this suddenly there has been some stir in the crowd that was sitting quietly till now near the poles
shifting from the midst of the poles saving themselves from the view of deployed soldiers suddenly many people had reached the procession road in the middle
some of them are filling the dirt of the procession road in anjuli some are pouring it on their heads some are rolling over there
it took little time to understand that they are taking the feet dust of the hermits saints
the police constables are slamming batons are abusing but not only men women are also rolling on the road and not leaving their chance to do their country paradise gratitude
maybe this will not give lesser blessings than taking dip in the sangam
when the sound of the next procession approaching was heard then the police showed their true form
then the spectators went back behind the poles
seeing the sangam bath of the akhara is also an experience
with the feeling of respect absolute satisfaction that the crowd takes dips not only the body it purifies the body soul inside
have not seen saints bathing like that
there was hardly any saint who did not dip up to the neck or head
after bathing when they were standing for return then did not see water dripping from their tangled hair
actually in the way they were taking the kumbh bath it was not like earning blessing but looting the blessing
they were aggressive
shankaracharya had built these naga akharas for the protection of religion
that is why today they are winning the blessings with their weapons on the chest of ganga
they are protecting religion
huge party of national international media is immersed in capturing in cameras this miraculous sight of the bath
in the midst of the first rays of the sun bursting from the horizon the bath of the naga saints then smearing ash on the body at the shore and standing waiting for return is unique sight for the cameras
foreign media is clicking and shooting here and there like mad
they are going absolutely close to the naga saints and taking close ups
famous for anger naga saints are in an amused mood today
they are giving different poses to the foreigners by the time of the coming of the kumbh of the twenty first century the saints have become media savvy
some enthusiastic cinematographers went far in the water of the ganga and took position and stood before the sangam entry of the naga saints
the akharas did not object at this
otherwise no one else can even enter in the sangam before them at festive bathing
the poor masses are left searching for blessing and redemption quite far from the real sangam at the shores of ganga or yamuna
for the media also this was really mahakumbh lrb the great kumbh rrb
where will one get so many stories and so many sights together in the world
that is why the media of the entire world independent journalists even paparazzi have positioned fronts in this kumbh
only the information department has made three large camps for the media
media persons are present in heavy numbers in personal pandals arenas hotels
from morning to late night they kept accumulating some or the other valuables
here from nude saints and bathing beauty to clad mystery and supernatural powers everything is available easy enough and free
in this even national media is not behind
the photographers have booked the boats in which they are roaming and capturing bathing women from different corners
volunteers of different institutions deployed for arrangement on the sangam banks are not only watching such scenes themselves very concentratingly but also show good shots to the camerapersons around
in the kumbha of nirmal verma in description written for dinaman had said at one place have never seen the policemen so disciplined in life
the entire battalion is watching the bathing women continuously
since am seeing equal form of discipline in not only policemen servants themselves journalists and salvation workers
crowd of lakhs is present today on the sangam shore lrb in this the wharf of this and that side of ganga yamuna are also included rrb
it is the initial estimation of the administration that almost one crore people will bathe the kumbh on makar sakranti
at the bath of the biggest silent new moon there is an estimation of three crore people coming
the approximation of so much crowd is also producing terror
am getting pushed and roaming in this crowd
when am not bathing in some or the other wave of the kumbh then would be feeling scared
god knows when there could be stampede
tingling happens
but the fair of kumbh is so diverse and queer that fear does not remain for long
some or the other goods some or the other news distracts attention
if you escaped from the boatmen insisting on getting you bathed on the ain sangam or rather triven then the barbers of nai bada invite with great request to get shaved or tonsured
for ten rupees they will shave the head and beard free alongside
otherwise five rupees for shaving the beard
the barber shop has been made by surrounding with poles
in which hundreds of barbers are gossiping
many people husband wife and children are walking tied together with the ends of dhoti or sheets
there is great fear of separating in the crowd
that is why this arrangement
announcements about lost found people are continuously happening on the central transmission system of the kumbh
lost people are calling to their friends in their language
the wistful cries of lost people in diverse languages on the loudspeaker also creates terror
there are two camps in the kumbh area by the name of lost found
both are filled
the view of the kumbh from shastri bridge is even more strange
the flow of the ganga cuts towards the city
that is why on the other shore towards jhunsi large field of sand has grown
on this field this time kumbh settlement has been based
all arenas camps exhibitions all types of pandals are all there
sangam shore meaning this end has been left fully empty
where crowd of fifty lakhs can easily assimilated
that is why the kumbh is appearing very organised this time looking above immeasurable crowd seems to be crawling like ants
if the arrangements are strong then the kumbh really fits in this sangam shore in prayag
in haridwar it shrinks collapses
had thought the sangam shore would be deserted today
after the royal bath of yesterday his condition would be like ploughed battle field
that is why in spite of excessive exhaution we went in the morning to the sangam shore
but it was definitely not found deserted
the crowd of bathers is all around
yes there is no chaos of the crowd sangam is not royal but of common people
women are drying their cloths in the wind after bathing
rainbow waves of colors are rising falling
we went to the middle of sangam taking boat
taking boat we went to the middle of sangam
there is good crowd of bathers in the middle of sangam
the constables of water police are alert and are controlling regulating the boaters
our boat man shows us the meeting line of ganga yamuna
the color of ganga is dirty brown
its flow is also fast
yamuna is calm deep
the color of the water is green wherever yamuna is meeting ganga as if line has been drawn
this meeting can be seen clearly
yamuna is joining ganga with lot of love
there is no resistance no bet silently get merged
such large yamuna how it mixes its identity in ganga
this surrender is unique
the number of times of prayag came sangam went the same experience happened
two days after the first royal bath the camps of akharas and religious associations of hermit saints became the den of politics
the second royal bath is on january
in between this on january the religious committee of the vishwa hindu parishad is going to happen
that is why there is lot of opportunity for politics and polarisation
although the coming going of bathers at sangam and the shores of ganga yamuna is underway continuously
the focus of the media has shifted from the shores because instead of the sangam of respect there is more spice in the slime of politics
after the afternoon we took leave from kumbhnagar
in the return towards lucknow the kumbh kept following till some time
then slowly that work business began to ride on the heart and mind
for which we were returning
the statue began saying that how in young scientist has discovered the formula of polythene eating moss
after the publication of his this observation in nature sensationalism spread
things from everywhere one after the other mutually related and unrelated also
nandadevi rajjat is one of the major popular festivals of uttarakhand
jat starts from nanda siddha peeth kurud and kansuwa in chamoli lrb not from nauti as is propagated rrb

the path of exactly one hundred from guwahati to bhutan passes through kamrup nalbadi and daranga districts
on keeping foot in bhutan by the majestic door made in the buddhist style in samdrup jonkar the first basasat of bhutan gives the feeling of entering some big monastery
the doors of this buddhist monastery could be opened in formal way for the world only after
for this reason bhutan has been successful in evading the cultural religious insurgency and societal natural misery and entering the twenty first century
bhutan is not only the medieval image of himalayas but is also the lone heritage of the entire tibetan cultural world being sacrificed in the flames of chinese communism
bhutan is one of those rare parts of the world where man is gentle and easy like the earth and is soaked with earth intimacy
the journey of such an earth is not just of geography history and society culture but more journey of the internal world
the commerce business and transport of eastern bhutan in the decade of the sixties

of its soldiers were killed and were wounded
after the famous centula treaty of the entire himalayan quadrant state from the dhansiri river on the border of arunachal to tista in the west came under the authority of the britsh
devthang was snatched from bhutan

the king changul pai of khaling had bravely fought with drupak ruler chogel minjur tempa
old houses with roofs of bamboo and the flat fields captured inside fences of bamboo were the identification of the old khaling

the central deprivation that divides the lesser himalayas and greater himalayas cuts the road four or five times before reaching the road
on the left side on the slope below ujrong is big village with which this descends into dagmechu
versong is in the extended himalayas
of the three major iron mines of bhutan one was in barsong with the help of which bridges were made in eastern bhutan with chains of iron and relationships were formed in divided communities

there are students in the schools of bhutan
two thirds of students are indian
even now the place of teachers is empty
like this there is vacancy at every level
the graduates of sherubtse will gradually fill up these vacancies
sherubtse is the brain of bhutan
the future of bhutan is dependent on the spirit and sensibility of this place
here not only did get chance to carry out my teaching duties fruitfully but also be part of the national development of bhutan
kanglung has begun to feel like my second home
the main city of old bhutan trashigang is situated at the confluence of dangmechu and gamrechu rivers km away from samdrup jongkhar
in along with the construction of trashigang jong by the third god king chogyal minjur tempa the area came under the administration of western bhutan
this jong of five storeys is the district headquarters of civil and religious administration
on entering the jong on the left side is the office of jongda lrb jongtrakila datramalik which can now be placed equal to jiladhish rrb
in the whole of the rest of building are lamas lrb gilongs rrb and their district head lama nitin
the prayer room of the idols of various postures of lord buddha and guru padmasambhav are made on every floor
there are collections of religious texts from the eighth century till present wall paintings and unique examples of tibetan art here
little away from the main building is the temple of matra devi of jong which protects the jong from enemies
in bhutan the regional administration is conducted from jong
there are twenty jong in all twenty districts where jongda and lama nitin are handling the civil and religious administration
climbing down from trashigong crossing the chajam lrb iron bridge rrb built on dangmechu road goes to trashiyangsi away from here
we took the direction of monger on crossing the river
the ruins of the iron chained year old bridge remain at chajam
now the indian border roads organization has made iron bridges on every river
after chajam after rolang the road comes in the lower himalayas
there is monastery made by the descendent of guru padmalingpa kunga gyeltsen in demchi climb from the main road
across from this is the valley of serichu
in senegalese language the meaning of seri is special type of fragrance
seeing the medicinal herbs with fragrance and gold colored serichu the memory of the seri of my village shook me
crossing seruchi the area of bhuskhalan begins
near the settlement wherever the earth became naked the restlessness of the himalayas is seen
small units of purification of lemon grass oil near the road only kilowatt of hydro electricity units pine trees one or two houses and seruchi valley wrapped in mist will be seen
yadi lrb feet rrb is beautiful village of four storeys houses near which is dense jungle of pine and acorn
little away from yadi after signs of dry lakes in flat slope fields of potatoes school and lakhang lrb buddhist temple rrb korila state is filled with deodar spruce fir larch and hemlock forests
in the middle of these dense jungles after crossing korila pass is kuri chu valley
from kuri chu valley monger jong looks like golden bird
road taking swift turn going through tongsing yangpugang kilikhar villages reaches the headquarters of monger district away from trashigong
this way cloth grain sugar utensils and oil reaches monger from guwahati
vegetables and sweet tea is not available in the market for working indians
when bhutanese people reach monger from faroff villages with wild fruits potatoes beans and radishes it becomes night
therefore on lighting torches market is set up in mongar
now some tin sheds have been made in mongar
perambulation has started increasing in the market
in mongar there are five storey buildings on one side and shops of wood on the other side
mongar jong is new whose construction was got done by the third king of bhutan jigme dorji wangchuck
there are ruins of an old gap or mandal lrb officer of block level rrb
there is an ancient trade route for going to tibet from lung tashi climbing down from mongar
some portion of trans himalayas is very beautiful here
here is singe jong made of granite stones
guru padmasambhava had meditated here near of this tiger shaped natural jong
on walking from mongar
there are horticultural poultry and pig farms in the broad bagad lrb rrb of limithang on crossing kurichu
the horse of arabian breed gifted to the prince of bhutan by former prime minister late rajiv gandhi has also been kept here
there are relics of old jongar jong near limithang
myth is rife that young man from these ruins used to come visit beautiful girl staying in the village nearby
later it was known that the young man was cobra
his offspring lives in these areas
people have full faith on this myth
leaving the valley of jimgon at from limithang we proceed towards yongkhu
the fifty road between yongkhu till sengor is filled with dangers
now apart from the horizon kissing jungles there is no other view on the ground
we were in the southern slope of the famous thrumshingla wildlife conservation point
there are rain forests in thrumshingla wildlife conservation
from limithang is the village of the labourers of namling road
there was more natural glow on the faces of the children living here than in the jungles
this is the area of land subsidence and landslides
the whole summit state was collapsing
the forest was in the flow of the stemming ganga by its own stomach
water all around trees became crooked the heap of granite rocks on the road as if they would tumble with gust of wind
the forest extensively wounded by its own beauty is beset with tectonic movements lrb because of the passing of the central faults rrb
on such ground cramped road sharp slopes on blind turns afternoons getting blind because of not reaching on the earth are suitable for silencing the travellers
the bus accident of june had happened here
passengers died in the bus accident of june
reaching height of thrumshingla at feet the experience is like that of climbing the back of an elephant
from here in the north the border of yumthang jokhang begins
lantushi in the north east jemgaon in the south and south east and near thrumsingala along with monger districts the borders of four districts come and meet
the rivers going east from here meet at kurichu and the rivers going west at yumthangchu
the royal bengal tiger has been sighted in thrumsingla
the first village in the midst of dense forests of fir spruce larch and deodar is gejam lrb metres rrb
there are eight ten houses of wood in gejam village
two big bukharis remain busy in preparing the shuja lrb salty snacks tea rrb gomans and rice for the travellers going back and forth in the gojam hotel
to come out of gejam is an experience like coming out of the mouth of some big tunnel
the river which was born from thrumsinghala and goes along till gejam that suddenly gets lost in deep caves
leaving that crossing slight backbone type mountain side we go down ura valley
ura valley opens out in all directions
it is as if the heights get break
like veils fluttering in the breeze is the ura village of animal tenders based on metres between the mountains sleeping in the sky
intermediate rulers of bhutan like gayden lama were born in ura
even today this is the village of authors like karma ura
the next camp was kurjelkhang
on entering kurjelkhang bound within hundred and eight chortens the first temple comes which had been made by sindhu king
the old pine tree planted in this temple seems to have grown from the stick of the guru
guru had sat here to meditate and on whichever stone the marks of his back were left that has begun to be called kurje
ugyen wangchuck the first king of bhutan when he was the trongsa penlap lrb governor rrb had got made the big idol and temple of guru
now the third largest temple has been made
in the compound of this temple group the tombs of all three late kings of bhutan is there
bumthang remained the capital of bhutan till
the birth of the first king of bhutan ugyen wangchuck also happened in bumthang
the wangdicholing lrb palace rrb made in jakar is the birth place of the first king
the other major attraction of bumthang is jakar jong
it is believed that when lama nage wangchuck wanted to get the construction of castle done near the confluence of the chokhochu and tangchu then he had found white bird sitting near the present jakar jong
probably it is possible that this could be the stork which comes on migration from tibet in the winter
the meaning of ja is big wide and the meaning of kar is white
the jong was known by the name made by these two words and its foundation stone was laid at that place
in chogel minjur timpa expanded the jong
in devraja gese tenzing rabge got the construction of this jong completed
the intermediate minar of this jong is feet high
bumthang has remained follower of the buddhist religion
guru pema lingpa lrb rrb believed to be the reincarnation of padmasambhav was born in the ironsmith family of lunglachel village of chokhor
he had established tamsing lakhang believed to be the center of nigampa community current of tantric buddhist religion
coming down from jakar jong we came to wangchungling village
the fields filled with potatoes and mustard were decorated with hives of bees
lines of school children were on both sides of the road
threw sad glance towards the forests collapsing from the valley
to escape the threat of cold climate the forests were being taken care of very well
it was possible only then to enjoy the happiness of bumthang bukhari
the market of bumthang is very clean and open
the next camp of the journey was at from trashigang
now we had to cover journey of from here to thimpu
who has seen the entire bumthang anyway
seeing bumthang valley means having seen its four valleys in which are conglomerated uma tang chokhor and chume
we reached chume valley based at metres from bumthang
the wool business of chume valley is famous
the shops decorated with colorful clothes of yata lrb una rrb of jugne village in chume and active women on bhutanese traditional handloom captured the heart
pralkhang near jugne and tharpling cave made on the right mountain give feel of the religious prosperity of the th century
the continuation of houses with orchards of apples and roofs of wood is found till jasta village
himani valley begins ahead and we get lost in seas of fir birch spruce and deodar
let the sonmarg baltal valley of kashmir be made wider and
yontongla rising gradually from the wide beautiful plain himani valley seemed sleeping like python
the area of himani valleys of from trumsingala to yontongla is ordinarily metres high
all around it are mountains to thousand feet high
monsoon also gets weak in bumthang based between these two valleys
in comparison to mongar and trashigang of old bhutan there is enough humidity here
my daughter aditi had gained success in recognizing eleven species of buransh between these two cracks and had thought as if the connection with the ground was lost
opposite to the western himalayas split in small and sharp valleys here are himalayas of aerial fields and wide brow
the slope of the other side of yongtongla lrb metres rrb
the gonpa or gumpa built in high places in bhutan are the meditation places of the lamas
some families have also begun settling near gonpa
the wintery basasatas based in the valleys are known by the name of pam in gonpa
there is movement of seasonal immigration between pam and gumpa
near dorsang the old prayer place has been changed to fields
from here the highest summit gankar punsu is sighted
bhutanese call the metre high gankar mountain bhrata with spiritual sentiment
mangdenchu coming from the root of gankar divides bhutan in two parts
without crossing the mangdechu one can not go across bhutan
therefore this valley is important both from the strategic and political viewpoint
trongsa jong seen from view point made before reaching trongsa and from the horror of the black mountain standing in its background the traveller as if trembles
the first two kings of bhutan had ruled from trongsa itself
the greatest trongsa jong of bhutan is this
on reaching trongsa we got relief
road goes from trongsa till gelfu based at the foothills of middle bhutan
cmlplt it
in with the purpose of liberating bhutan from internal calamities however many forts made in present bhutan in them trongsa jong is also included
it is believed that in the times of nagiwandchuk lrb rrb the construction of big chorten was got done here
this jong made on cliff standing over the trongsa river got completed in many phases
trongsa situated at metres seems like common himalayan settlements
taking round of the road again comes close to trongsa jong from across mangde chhu again
after seeing sarchop or eastern bhutan in the east from thrumsingala jupcho or middle bhutan between thrumsingala and pelela we are advancing towards jangcho or western bhutan
from rubakji to novding across pelela not only is extraordinary natural beauty spread instead it was unique experience to see the various borders of ascending and descending vegetation covered in the heights
we were climbing with the support of nikachu coming out from morothong and meeting in chendbaji in that direction
now we will have to descend with dangchu merging in sankosh the large river of western bhutan
near about khelekha and garjikha village we met dangchu
while passing through chodojha near lantenjanga crossing this wangdi valley opens
wangdi lrb metres rrb situated between the forests of scattered pines and mountains in the distance is the only such valley of bhutan which is identical to many valleys of kumaon
seeing the houses with roofs of slate reminded me of kumaon
chiring the stewardess of hotel orchard said that workers making carvings on stone and jong lrb forts rrb stay in riching gong situated nearby
cmplt it
trosing in the east chirang and dagna in the south punakha in the north and thimpu paro and ha jongkhal fall in the west
in the big prayer room of wangdi phodrang the stories relating to the previous birth of padmasambhava and buddha are drawn
the importance of wandgi phodrang jong also increased due to its proximity to punakha
punakha remained the winter capital of bhutan till
even today the central lama association of bhutan travels to punakha in winters
by the time of crossing mochu which flows in the root of wangdi phodrang night has fallen
white sand shining at the bank of mochu and in between the setting celestial redness the beauty of the wangdi fodrung jong is to be seen to be believed
the approximately year old bridge built on mochu had been swept away by the flood of
now new iron bridge has been built here
the new wandgi phodrang city is settling by the support of mochu
although the old wangdi city is also clean and open
at some distance in lobasa the natural resources center began in
road from lobasa goes to talo
thimpu is now only
there was no opportunity of going to talo
in talo the reincarnation of the spiritual teacher sabdrung navang nagmel of bhutan has been taking birth
in november two feet inches high golden idol of sabdrung jigme dorjee has been established in machelkhang of talo
in mache lrb remains rrb lakhang many old remains of sabdrung have been kept safe
the body of sabdrung is protected in punakha jong itself
we reached dorchula at ten clock at night
dorchula is the dividing line of thimpu and punakha valleys
in dorchula there is an old chorten and prayer pole
the road goes down towards thimpu
the bright light of ghantaghar has given the feeling of reaching thimpu
shimmering thimpu is the image of the present of bhutan
from the main market norjim of thimpu towards chorten lama lrb road rrb on walking just few steps on the left is hotel
today is th april of
in the forest of blue pine on the western mountains of thimpu the golden rays of the sunrise have reached
thimpu has awakened
gradually children dressed in pink banded and blue colored gho kira lrb the gradual national costume of men and women rrb have begun to be seen on the road
reach at norjen corner
there is an abundant number of vehicles in the city
both sides lined shops houses are made in the traditional style of bhutan
houses with flat roofs of concrete have started breaking this grandeur
there are indian items at shops but the cars running on the roads are japanese
now the maruti car has also finished this competition
thimpu is city budding with the produce of the power of its increasing external contacts and its past
along with the capital thimpu is also city of hope for the future
thimpu is center of beliefs and faith
thimpu is the dearest city of every bhutanese
the house of their king is in thimpu
thimpu also loves every bhutanese equally
this quality will be less in other cities
in the first meeting that happened with thimpu this had started feeling like my own
we saw thimpu city on coming to the bhutan radio broadcast centre attached to motithang
this city is based by the support of thimpu chu in the north south direction in the middle of docin choling to simtokha
limes of snow were still remaining in the mountains of dorchula there
thimpu valley is approximately long and wide taking height of metres from sea level makes shape of drawn bow with thimpu chu lrb river rrb
the center of this valley is tashi chojong lrb of jong of great religion rrb
in while changing an ancient cave to jong sabdrung navang had given this name
although in
in the third deshi lrb king rrb of bhutan got the expansion of this done
here in the religious rupture continuing between tibet and bhutan was ended by signing on the treaty
subject to this treaty the bhutanese delegate kept being sent to lhasa
in principle the dongon gumpha was not in the valley but little higher up where now the central gumpha school of bhutan runs
the th devraj of bhutan serab wangchuk had got the construction of this done at the place of the present jong made in the valley in
damages had been caused to this jong in the fire of and
in the father of the first king of bhutan jigme namgel had got the renovation of this jong done and the construction of temple done
after days we left for paro
we descended by the support of thimpu chu
parochu beside kinsilsila mixes in the thimpu chu
from here we recognized the road going towards paro
paro is from thimpu
the lower valley of paro is sankri and shushk
at sunjajom on crossing paro chu we move ahead from the left bank paro remains from here and the valley starts opening
we headed straight towards the paro air strip
the only aircraft of bhutan has left on the flight for bangkok
remembered the european father jovo cabrel and istebhavo casilla who entered bhutan on th march
on reaching paro both these travellers were made imprisoned by bhutanese traveling with them in his house
somehow on escaping from his grasp these two had met sabdung navang namgel the propagandist of spanish religion
to live with these monks three lamas had been given relaxation
some local people came to see the idols of jesus and mary and to tell their sorrows
but on not seeing any interest developing towards christianity these two monks had gone to western tibet after staying in paro till months
in bhutan then there was refusal to any outside person coming barring saints and hermits
bhutanese historians write that once when the uncle of the king of cooch behar reached paro in the eagerness of seeing bhutan he had also been imprisoned here
the alliance of bhutan with the rest of the world was subsisted only after the indo china war
the development work began in bhutan with indian help
in the first school opened in paro
in electricity came roads were built and now an air strip is also made here
the nearby villages still have houses with roof of wood and walls of mud
wealthy families have started putting roofs of steel
we reached paro market directly
the dungse chorten lakhang built here is unparalleled in the whole of bhutan
paro market of clean and wide roads has been settled in systematic manner
the crowd of villagers buying yak meat and the shops of video cassettes together presented new old paro
on going little ahead only is the temple of yongthang gyalpo
all the iron chain bridges built in the th century in bhutan is the contribution of this lama engineer
now we reached tajong by taking long circular route
from this tajong of five storied cyclorama at some time royal soldiers must be guarding the main jong
the district headquarters is still in the main jong
but the only museum of bhutan is now situated in tajong
we saw paro valley from tajong
the crop of jowar in the valley is prospering
apples have swollen on the slopes
descending from paro market we proceeded towards drugyel jong away from here
the entire valley gets divided in exactly two parts by paro market
there are fields of wheat and pine below paro market
the upper valley is covered with spruce birch hemlock and blue pine forests
in the upper valley only is the biggest buddhist pilgrimage takchang cave of bhutan
any traveller returning from bhutan is filled up with nature consciousness
such vibrant and complete nature will be found only in some areas
bhutan reared in the shadow of lamas like gurupadmasambhava pemalingpa sabdrung navang namgale and tenzing and their reincarnations is completely religious place
the second big happiness of this journey is also seeing the new just created budding and taking the speed of development society
we have not relished the happiness of creation in india
the lama gurus coming from tibet have strengthened the religious cornerstone of bhutan so not only did the foundation of economy go from india to butan on the other hand indian buddhist religion taught bhutan the first lesson in civilization and culture
bhutan is running towards the west with great speed
in this race it is difficult to maintain the identity of bhutan
had to go straight in the direction of north till mansarovar
now this decision had to be taken that how to reach there
only had the support of compass
had to go forward from atkal itself
stopping walking north east hoisted the package on my back and started descending
till now the side of the mountain that was walking on the heat of the sun was more on that side the snow was also not more than inches but now had to walk on the other side
there the heat of the sun used to reach very less
so my feet used to sink till inches in the snow at some places
in some places the snow was only inches because of which started feeling increasing tiredness
had the support of stick
at places my feet used to get stuck in stones of ice and extraction used to become difficult
my tibetan shoes tore completely
blood began flowing from the cuts from the legs
my load was not heavy but now it seemed that strenuous
like this found three mile straight road
on going five miles ahead found two lakes
these were made by the melting of snow
the circumference of one was almost five miles and of the other was miles
colourful ducks were swimming in it
the number of ducks was so much that the water of the lake was also not visible
seeing the view there got so enchanted that forgot the pains of my body completely
kept the name of the big lake as ikai and of the smaller one jinko
on looking at the compass realized that for going north east had to cross the river
but this was not pleasant as the previous experience was still fresh
the time when was thinking this at that time saw man crossing the river
on asking it was known that he was going from kham to gilang ringponch for visit
explained to him that am getting very weak give me help in crossing the river
saying this gave him lot of eatables
he became very happy with my generosity and he picked up my things on his back and holding my hand began walking forward
after helping me cross the river he told me the road ahead and again crossing the river he went away
also took my route
on walking fourteen miles we found the kyangchu river
at distance of fifty miles from here mountain covered with snow can be seen
this comes out from this mountain only
its span is maximum yards and minimum yards
before descending we had our supper
that time was guest of the ladakh merchant
his servants collected dry dung etc prepared food and would read religious texts
while leaving alchu lama had given me little rice
here the rice comes from nepal and is available very expensive
had eaten rice after very long time so it felt very tasty
had reached the bank of the river by clock
the ice on the bank was frozen as it is
waited till the melting of the snow and began making arrangements for lunch
had wished this that the load of the goats be left on their backs and to release them across the river
but this could not happen as the river was deep
in the end removed the load and took them with the help of rope
the depth of the water was lot so even on gathering my clothes properly they got wet
the goats would have swam but without the rope they would definitely have been swept away by the force of the water
we crossed easily
on getting to the other bank tied the goats to tree
took off all my clothes and putting them out to dry went naked to the other shore for getting things
getting there applied oil to the body for second time and made such bundle of all my things which could lift on my head
keeping the bundle on my head entered the river for the third time

on earth are many wonders
some are natural and some man made
at some places nature has made earth to wear such beautiful sheet that its panorama is spectacular
some landscapes of earth are such that they do not look like parts of earth
discussion of such peculiar parts that give different face to earth
there are such peculiar landscapes in the european country iceland situated at northern atlantic ocean that on seeing them you might consider it as different planet
where you will see smoke and bubbles in the rocks here you will also find solidified snow here
you will be able to see such marvellous confluence on earth with difficulty

the population density here is only persons per square kilometer
europe biggest glacier vatnajokull is also here

it is like riddle for scientists because they are not unanimous on its construction
some believe it to be result of collision of meteorite then some believe it to be construction of weathered rocks
some believe it to be result of earth united elevation then for some it is result of all the three reasons
if place that looks like another planet can be found on earth then it is sokotra ireland

it is completely inhabited and its geographical conditions can work as inspiration of new designs to any graphic designer
the trees and plants here are of weird shape the viewer of which is unable to contain his wonder

meena mosque mughal emperor got this tiny mosque of white marble made for his own personal use
there are three archs in its prayer room and in front of it is an open courtyard
there is no design in it and is completely simple
it is surrounded by very high walls and is estimated that when shahjahan stayed imprisoned in musamman burj situated nearby which is also called shah burj from to he used to read namaaz in this mosque only
nageena mosque it is personal mosque which shahjahan got made in white marble in for the women of his harem
on its three sides are courtyards and its open and ventilated but even then for purdah high walls are made all around it
there are three archs on the two facades and entrance of the prayer hall which are jagged as per the style of shahjahan
these arches are settled on expansive feet base
the arch in the middle is bigger than the archs at the back
the roof which is on the entrance is curvaceous from the middle which means above the middle entrance and in similar way there is curve in the balcony above it
there are bulb like domes on the head which are decorated with mahapadam and kalash
the middle dome is big and high
the bunglow like elements which means the circular curve of balcony and parapet gave special importance to the elevation of main hall and building and this is the unique feature of this building
both the roofs of the main hall are also triangular like bunglow
mughal emperor got the shahi hamam which is also known as bathroom made originally
shahjahan renovated it
it is an expansive palace wherein ashtrastra halls and rooms are there which are associated to balconies
except some netted ventilators towards yamuna it is closed from all sides
the stairs towards the east used to down to the surface where two furnaces were constructed
right above them is an instrument cabin in the instrument cabin above the furnace were two big copper cauldrons
the mud and copper pipes which are fitted inside the walls mysteriously go till other rooms from here
very small ponds were made and hid in the corners of walls of some rooms and at the height of izaars
the secret of its working is not known to us today
it has been constructed with bricks but basically on floors and on izaars marble was laid
after plastering the wall with lime stone colorful designs were made
all rooms were connected with some cold arrangement made beneath the floor
above every room is dome like roof on the top of which is ventilator
towards the back of this palace are some toilet rooms for royal use
it seems from this machine process that some sort of air conditioning arrangement was here and its use was mainly as summer palace
as per what foreign travellers have written secret work was done here
this hammam is counted among mughals best hammams
on its roof are three deep ponds
they were filled with river water through the persian wheel
these persian wheels used to run near khizri or watergates
the water from the ponds on roofs is taken to nageena mosque machhi bhavan fountains of sheeshmahal and musamman burj waterfalls and ponds
it is visible that during mughal period the water of yamuna was completely clean pure and worth drinking
emperor shahjahan also used to drink the same water
after the somgarh battle aurangzeb encircled the fort and ceased the supply of water from this river due to which the emperor surrendered on june
after this for the protection of the fort aurangzeb got expansive gadhgaj made in front of the fort doors
jahangir chain of justice lrb zanjeer adal rrb lrb rrb it is that place where mughal emperor jahangir established the chain in
he has written in his autobiography that after royal ordination the first order he gave was this that the chain of justice should be put up with which if the people involved in the administration of law cause delay or evil then the victim coming here can shake this chain for getting justice so that my attention garnered by its sound
this chain was made of pure gold
its length was yards lrb feet rrb and there were bells on it
its weight was mana lrb quintal rrb one end of it was tied to the dome of shah but located close to it and the other was tied to stone pillar at the river bank
this chain was not mere imagined tale
contemporary foreign travellers like william hawkins had seen it themselves
it has also been illustrated in contemporary painting made in
this was unique experiment for abatement of people troubles
without any fee fear and formality the public could reach the emperor directly lrb who was supreme in the judicial system rrb and could get immediate justice
in this judiciary no discrimination of caste or religion nor difference between rich and poor this is no doubt dream for modern jurists but lesson as well
this marvellous arrangement for justice of jahangir that is adal jahangir became an example in indian history
gazani gate lrb rrb originally this was placed in the tomb of mahmud ghaznavi situated in ghazni
mahmud ghaznavi died in in the british uprooted and brought it here
in the historical declaration of lord alenbro it was said that this was that this is the very sandalwood door which was stolen mehmood in from somnath and this way the british have avenged the year old insult
this lie was wrought to gain sympathy of the common people of india
in reality this gate is gazni local deodar wood and not sandalwood
its design is entirely different from the ancient wood art of gujarat
an inscription is also engraved in its upper part in which there is clear description of mahmud along with laudatory attributes
sir john marshal had installed notice board of this intent along with description of this event and the gate
this gate is feet high and feet wide
its weight is around half ton
in the end the thought to fix this door again in somnath was abandoned and it stayed there in the room
it has no relation to mughals or their fort it has been left behind either in the form of victory symbol of british campaign or in the form of special memory of the historical lie of east india company
this beautiful palace is made on the highest garret of the fort of main agra towards east towards the river
emperor akbar basically got it made of red stone for oriel window sight
after sunrise everyday akbar would also pray sun from there only
jahangir also used it as an orial window this has exhibited clearly in its painting made in the year
he also put up his adal zanjeer at its south only
because it is an ashtastra it is called as mussaman burj
its mention in parisian history records and foreign traveller descriptions has been by the names of shah burj shahi burj or baadshahi burj also and to call it jasmine tower or summan burj would de unethical and wrong
the way contemporary historian lahori has written shahjahan renovated it with marble in the middle of
he also used it for orial window view
it is visible that like court this was also semi important mughal institution
it is an octagonal building whose outer arms are extended towards the river in the form of verandah
every arm is opened through pillars and sides
the arm of the east is extending more towards the front and the royal oriel window is made on it only
towards the western side of this palace is an expansive verandah in which shah nashi are made
reservoir is made in its floor
decoration is done through mosaic in it
beyond this veranda is courtyard in the north of which is netted terrace
in west there are gradual rooms till sheeshmahal and in south is cabin and pillared courtyard
this way it is huge family which is completely made of white marble
there are deep inscriptions engraved on the walls so that the walls do not look empty or desolate
on the margins of verandas designer vines have been joined through mosaic and their middle natural old people are etched through carving
this was directly associated with diwaan khaas sheesh mahal khaas mahal and other palaces from here only mughal emperor used to run the administration of the entire nation
from this burj complete scene of tajmahal is seen and shahjahan spent years of his imprisoned life here only and here only he died
his body was taken to taj mahal by boat and burried there

people traveling has been affected this year due to recession
although the situation in the last two months of the year was ok but the growth of industry was equivalent to zero for rest of the month
no doubt due to budget concepts little earning was made possible but it did nt even prove to be any port in storm
this year swine flu also harmed this industry badly
although its effect was visible less on domestic travel but international market the biggest mode of income turned out to be deal in loss
initially the plague that swine flu seemed to be considering that people did nt travel for months
during this time medical check ups conducted at airports and other scrutinies also decreased people inclination towards traveling
then the increase in the air fare also proved to be harmful for travel industry
complete focus of industry was on earning profits
the result came out to be that those agencies which used to make inexpensive trips available
the frequency of flights was less due to which it could not become mode of income for the industry
the beginning of was with the fear of
due to declaration of high alert in the country the number of tourists coming to india decreased
advance bookings were also canceled
its effect was seen for six months
all those big places which used to be heaven for tourists tourists started to hesitate from staying there
although due to installation of tight security in hotels the trust of tourists rose again but in months the hotel industry underwent complete loss
yes another factor was elections
this time some more elections were held with loksabha elections they were also pretty harmful for tourism
during this time international travel was completely stalled for some months
domestic travel increased but it was not so much that any positive effect could have influenced on travel industry or the industry could come over the blow of recession
although lot happened at the name of development but the market went down due to recession
if there would be no money then how will people travel
due to salary cuts and downsizing nobody could even think of traveling and enjoying
it is clear this year has not been good for tourism sector
every year guests coming to india in huge numbers did nt come and indians also did nt go on foreign trips to travel
no doubt the travel industry was effected due to it but hotel industry also ran into losses
then every airline increased their fares for the months from april to october earning months for tourism
on one hand companies deducted salaries down sized on the other traveling became expensive
it result was that of local tourists traveled through buses and trains
during elections tourism came to standstill for four months
goa and rajasthan were two such states from where good amount was earned from there also tourism industry could not earn much

the credit for making the first hindu temple in america goes to the vedanta samaj
vedanta samaj laid the foundation of temple in san francisco city in
after this temples were made in hollywood in and santa barbara in
these temples were built on the basis of the image of hinduism which vivekananda presented in his speeches in the center of which were hindu religious texts and the entire effort was put to understand it essence
keeping idol worship in mind the construction of temples started at that time in when indian hindus started immigrating to america in huge numbers
it main reason was that in the restrictions imposed on asian migrants immigrating to america were relaxed
temples made in america in near about can be divided in two divisions
in the first division are iskcon temples which were made for special group
such temples come under the second division which were made for hindus and whose motive was to bring together hindus from various cultures
this is why they developed various procedures to worship
bhaktivedant swami prabhupad lrb rrb founder of iskcon came to new york in
within one year he established an ashram at second avenue wherein he used to give sermons on geeta on monday wednesday and friday
during sermons he used to tell young americans about the preachings of saint chaitanya
in his view the tradition of teacher student and worshipping in temples had lot of importance
isckon built temples in american cities
of them the most grand temple is the palace of gold situated in new vrindavan of west virginia
there is an isckon temple in the northern central new jersey at jacksonville road
this temple is situated at the peak of mountain
according to the followers of isckon since twenty years isckon has its property on this temple
on all its four sides is beautiful garden which is taken care of by the followers
the temple has total land of acres
according to the american law religious places with more than acre land have to pay tax
many followers also stay here and at special occasions followers from nearby areas gather here
followers continuously inspire new people to follow the devotion path as per isckon
there is enough place in the temple for worshipping
idols are placed in front of the entry gate
these idols of traditional style are made to worn
all idols are of various forms of sri krishna and are dedicated to the worship of krishna
here besides historical people like shri krishna chaitanya and shree niyananda idols of jagannath baldeva and subhadra are also there
the temple remains open on all seven days of the week but sunday is an important day and on that day two to three hundred people gather
maximum followers are north indians but some european american are also included in them who will be seen in indian attire
programs start at in the evening in which hare krishna mantra chant singing of devotion songs and hymns and idol worship are included
after that spiritual talk and prasad distribution takes place
after prasad community meal is also organised and the task of making of food is done by the followers only
speaker is also called on this occasion who gives sermon on spirituality and presents the community with leadership
speakers are the members of the managing committee
there are members in the committee chosen by prabhupad
members of the committee only present leadership to the isckon temples situated in various areas of america
the traditional temples of india are not run like the isckon temples
in traditional temples devotees in huge numbers gather in the worship rituals that take place daily
in in america such temples were devoted to the devotees
of them one temple is maha vallabh ganpati devsthanam in the flushing area of new york which is popular as ganesh temple
the second is the shri venkateshwar temple situated in the pittsburgh area of pennsylvania but contrary to temples in india in american temples an effort to produce communal harmony among hindus is made
the famous hindu temple of chicago is remembered for vivekananda speech
in new jersey venkatesh temple is very popular among the hindus which is known as balaji temple
in the in america initially normal houses made of brick and cement were given the form of temple
worship rituals and cultural programs were organised in them
towards the end of the decade the course of making grand temples on the hill tops began
religious organizations started to collect charity from the devotees for the construction of temples during the
the course is still on
many temples have been constructed in the suburbs of new jersey

in rajasthan ms away from jaipur is situated shree kalyanji temple in the degree town of tonk district

construction of the present temple was done under the reign of rana sangramsingh in the year
it is noteworthy that although the idol enshrined in the temple is of lord vishnu but several forms of the lord are visible to the devotees in it
everyday there is crowd of devotees and on every full moon night and ekadashi huge fair is held
three big fairs are held in year on vaishakh poornima shravan month amavasya and ekadashi of bhadrapad
it is believed that this abode of lord kalyanji and his attractive idol like kalpavriksha in kalyug is the fulfiller of human wishes and remover of all their problems
especially for patients and lepers lrb people suffering from leprosy rrb is believed to be an incarnate sankatmochan
why sankatmochan for lepers
why is it mystery contained in the story of their origin
in brief the story is that once devraj indra expelled urvashi from heaven
she started living on chandragiri hill near the capital of king digva on earth
the king was attracted towards her and had to wage war against indra to procure her
king digva lost
urvashi cursed the king to suffer from leprosy
lord vishnu gave solution on the king getting perturbed that after some time my idol will come flowing in sea and you will recover from leprosy by paying obeisance to it and by drinking foot ambrosia
the king recovered from the disease
the place at which the king fought battle with indra there established kalyanmayi idol of lord vishnu
since then till today this idol is famous as kalyaanji

as compared to the international tourism indian tourism did not have to bear much loss
discount and increasing facilities have made the middle class the king of market
it may be domestic or international tourism tourists made full use of low costs
due to terrorist attacks recession and swine flu there was decrease in the number of foreign tourists but the effect on domestic tourism was less
especially on pilgrimages there was no effect of terrorist attacks and swine flu
where to percent of decrease in tourist activities was registered in europe and america in india this percentage was only around
in the initial months of the year it was more
with the beginning of holiday season positive mood began to develop in tourism industry
tourism department and tour operators lured tourists by giving discounts and attractive packages
on one side where there pessimistic atmosphere due to the deficiency that came in advance booking last moment booking gave relief to the tourism department
by the middle of the year life began to return to the tourism world
ti invite foreign tourists with the support of hotels airlines and other segments year was declared as visit india year but tourist industry could not reap it enough benefits
in the month of november this year lakh foreign tourists came which is percent less than the tourists who came in november last year
the number of tourists coming to india from january to november was lakh whereas there was hope that more than sixty lakh foreign tourists will come in
but despite all this till november in the income of foreign income five percent of increase has been registered as compared to last year
through international tourism income of rs was earned till november in and this year till november this number reached to crores
with the aim of controlling their budget corporate sector put halt on the travels and meetings and conferences being held in foreign countries whose direct impact was felt on convention centres airlines and hotel industry
apart from this downturn was seen even in leisure tourism
if the reason for it was downsizing by the companies then on the other hand people considered it better not to set out on excursions due to recession
the major reason for reduction in the number of inbound tourists in india was terrorism and swine flu
it one positive aspect was this that by not receiving enough booking of foreign tourists tourism industry and government attention was diverted to organise and boost domestic tourism
tourists adopted the policy of turning long break holiday into short break holiday
tourists liked allinclusive packages the most
even honeymoon destinations could not escape from the blow of recession and swine flu
even during the peak of wedding season hotel room booking was less in these areas

suddenly my foot slipped from rock
because of being little tires and because of some burden fell in water and the bundle fell off far from my head
did nt get time to use the stick
held the bundle with one hand promptly and started to swim with another
was moving forth in deep waters
at first thought came to me that if do the business of saving the bundle then ll drown but very soon thought that without bundle also will die because had to walk ten days more and meeting humans on that way was difficult
now realized that do not have the power to ascend
therefore came down so that will climb after becoming healthy staying beneath the mountain for some days
after descending for around miles found another river
beneath it again was the kingdom of snow
after seeing this feared that this time if have to spend night in such snow then will die for sure
at that very time only heard bird voice

such beautiful scene had never seen
this river was some yards wide
descended to valley after crossing it
therefrom saw some animals at distance similar to mountain buffalos
had been disillusioned many times
now by their gait did realize that they are buffaloes by looking at them came to know that here is human settlement somewhere near
some shepherd was grazing buffalos when saw upclose
came to know when asked that these people had come last evening

started to walked towards it

on reaching its bank began to wait for my mates
when everybody reached then crossed that mountainous river
the water was till waist in it
mules crossed it easily
stayed by its edge for the entire day today
in the evening kept playing for two hours with stones alone while sitting on the bank of damyanti river
high current was flowing in front

beginning from height of feet and gradually towards slope feet gyanima plateau has gradually gone towards west on the edge of sutlej valley
there are absolutely no stones in this plateau there is much comfort for the traveller to walk because at various places there are water springs the land is very cold at night the snowy caps of himalayas are also near
july sunday in the morning itself we turned towards teerthpuri after biding farewell to our loving bhotiyas
good people came to drop us till mile
on wage of rs took along guide till teerthpuri
it was eight already and plains were visible till far ahead of us
the air here is so clear that the thing far away is clearly visible and the beholder suffers from the illusion of it being near
when lot of time has been spent while walking and even then the destined object can be seen right in front then our folly is realized by us
after walking for two miles reached on the bank of lake
this lake is on an elevated land
it is known that it water springs out of region surrounding gyanima mandi or must be some other reason
took short nap here for while
then walking on plains and after crossing rivulet we reached pasture
many chanvar cows and sheep were grazing here
the camp of their masters huns was also nearby
first thought that should stay here there was danger of robbers ahead but later we moved ahead putting faith in god
after crossing this square field we reached beneath dry hill
searched for water here and there but could not find
climbed the hill thirsty
when we reached the other side after crossing this hill valley was visible ahead
this is sandy valley between very small dry hills
where will place better than this worth plundering by robbers will be found
after drinking the nectar of faith we entered the valley
the sun set while crossing it
reached spring tired and thirsty
very little water was oozing out from here
we halted at dry mountain rivulet near this
collected cow dung cakes from here and there
the one who was the guide brought wood
ate sattu at night and passed the entire night in front of fire did nt even take an hour sleep
we set off at five in the morning only on monday july
reached on the top of the hill with lot of effort
many laden jhabbus lrb cross breed of yak and cow rrb were coming here
two three jewel traders were along their desire was to reach gyanima
right on the banks of the sutlej river is the famous pilgrimage of teerthpuri
there are caves dug in hillocks here to stay room like structures have been made
had to spend night in one such cave
for their stay lama people have made caves of such kind
those travellers who come to pay visit to the temple of lord buddha in teerthpuri all of these con them only
came after us as well would ask for sattu continuously
the night went by some how
july tuesday early morning went to see hot water springs
ona white hill boiled water was emanating out from various places
at one or two places water was so hot that we could not even touch it
the boiling water that comes out from these sulphur springs comes from the devil pond under the earth
travellers call this place as the heap of bharmasur
right beneath mandhata mountain is taklakot mandi
traders from byaans chaudaans daarma and nepal come to sell their products over here
the indian name of loss here is lipulekh
it must be miles from taklakot
the water of rivers have been utilised through canals after irrigating land on all sides grain is sown
where water has not reached that land has worn baldness
rain does not fall much over here whatever grain is produced here is through irrigation only
there are villages in the district of taklakot
they are settled on the banks of the rivers
the houses here are of stones mud is plastered on it are good for work
near every village field of barley and peas were seen
there was greenery frequently on the way towards shrikhocharnath monastary
the land is very fertile
do nt know why there was scarcity of trees everywhere
the land wherein oats and peas can be there why ca nt fruit trees be there looks like nobody gave an attempt
underneath snow like snake stuck to dark stones mandakini was spitting out poison on colliding on stones
on the both sides of our way wild roses were bursting with which forest godesses used to decorate themselves our lives
now we were guests of the himalayas
after walking some more distance ahead chatti was found where after staying night long we set out towards kedarnath
kedarnath was left only miles away from here
mile was completed
miles were completed
because it is climbing path that is why took time
further there are no trees on road but green grass
himalya daughter arpana pray to kedarnath shankar here no songs on her lips no flowers of lust in her heart she is pure ascetic in whose eyes rapids of purity are falling and pure light is reflecting on her face
paid visit to kedarnath temple
saw up close
looked on the top of the temple green grass had gone to
we have heard that there is pond named vaasuki in the waters of which are lotus of various colors
he becomes deaf does not listen to anyone neither understands
divine beauty comes on his face and while singing he is lost somewhere behind the mountains forever
we though that the condition that takes place for those who go to vaasuki pond the same condition happened to us while on the way to kedaarnath
we came back only with our bodies
the maidens of vasuki taal stole away our hearts
was in kolkata in the november of
some traps who wandered on the paths outside the popular paths in himalayas came to meet at the end of one journey
they had also brought colored paardarshiyaan of journey along
after saying and listening on the topic of the journey which was specially regarding the snow and glacial path from raansi to kedarnath adviced that when even have fondnedd towards the unknown ways then even should enjoy that journey
told us further that in raansi till mandani some shepherds go through difficult paths
after that the way till kedarnath was unknown and he was one of the first people to walk on that way
was given warning that it wo nt be appropriate to travel during rainy season
my heart got ready instantly and even began practical preperations
it was decided such that let travel in the june of
first posted letter to our known porter jotisingh rana lrb kunethji from kalimath rrb
it was written to bhatt ji that he will arrange for porters and ration water kerosene etc as well
because we will have to walk for many days above the tree line so kerosene oil is very important
jyotisingh also thought that the journey will begin from helang and not from kedarnath
started preperations after receiving acceptance letters from everyone
from helang rached kolkata on the evening of th june
luckily jyotisingh was found in chamoli only
he was standing at the bus station in my anticipation
in helang we prepared mana resident paansingh as our porter
he stayed us with madmaheshwar
bought enough ration required till th june
due to non availability of any place for night stay the night was spent in the tea staller shop and was spent with joy
in the morning of june all three of us set out after lifting our luggage
crossed alaknand through hanging bridge and while walking on the climbong path reached reached first village salna
greenery raprured our hearts
nainitaal mountaineering club created history by crossing these trails pass lrb metres rrb in the years of its silver jubilee and the birth century year lrb rrb of george willaiam trail
this pass is known by the name of initial commissioner trails and is situated on the top of pindari gul
the importance of trails pass was in th century when traders used to go to milam valley through it
thorough this way tibet can be reached in very less time
in the course of ime this path was closed down
when trail was appointed the commissioner of kumauon then he initiated the opening fthis pass
he put proposal to open this path in front of the people of gori and pindar valleys
while crossing trails pass we considered it safe to go from tough and relatively longer way fthe southenr slope instead of using the traditional way
the eastern path from gull mukh to trails pass is shorter no doubt but due to the threats of continous falling pack ice cracks and icy rocks the path is full of dangers at every step
in the last years this way has been passed only five times through thise way
from southern slope the path from which we went towards trails pass we were trapped there for many days on that in october during nandakhaat expedition lrb rrb
finally we were able to cross it only after using kms long rope
on october from surakhrak we left for takhta camp at height of metres
it is situated on the south eastern slope of nandakhat peak
its naming was done due to plates suppressed in ice and stones during nandakhat campaign of
possibly they were used at some time to cross the snow crevices
they were lying as it is due to being there in snow
we made one or two boards stand upright after taking them out so that mountaineers coming from down should know the situation of camp
in the early morning of th october we leaped towards the trails pass empty handed
in half an hour we were at the pass
today we were successful in reaching till this destination after years
from trails pass the main and the eastern summits of nandadevi can be seen right in front
longstaff coal is also right in front which joins nandadevi with nandakhaat of yesteryears and creates the outer wall of nandadevi sanctuary
on the pass we hoist flags of our country nainital mountaineering club mountain lrb askot arakot mission rrb and of mataji of arvind ashram
today we had cleared the aim which was invincible and difficult
in this way we had repeated history by reaching here after years
all members were happy and thrilled
after photography we returned to the camp and taking luggage from there we returned to the pass
marvellous sight was there when we woke up on the morning of th october
wherefrom we had descended down yesterday that lane was looking clear
nanda devi east and longstaff kol in front were looking really high
sheet of golden sunlight was laid
on all four sides were hanging glaciers seerecs and snow cracks
in the happiness of passing trails pass we congratulated and hugged each other
it was team spirit only due to which we were able to cross all dangers successfully
after tea jumping through cracks we moved left towards nandadevi
he welcomed us warmly and served tea
slide film was finished with me
he gave me that too happily
on one side grand scene of eastern peak of nandadevi is seen from this place then on the other hand while descending down to martoli nandakot and kuchela peaks are seen together
we had to go through moraine ahead wherein beautiful pond was also there
there were heaps of bhojpatra and juniper leaves at one place which had come down sliding from snow
this area was burnt badly by musk hunters
today we reached lavaan village at after walking for about kms
only one family stays over here
the entire village has turned into ruins
the source of water is also far
we got rice from the porters of spanish group
today the delicious food we had of rice and potato curry after three days it taste we will not be forgotten in life
in the morning began to climb the steep mountain and after climbing for an hour we were in taati thalkot bugyal
anwaal daansingh returning from chafua was from village named kanyaari
they were descending herd of around sheep
he told us that eight herds of sheep ranging from small to large are there in their village in which there are around sheep
another series of ascent to talla rantham and then malla rantham from chafua
we were standing at such point on the mountain peak at height of about metres wherefrom we were able to see till far in all the directions
we reached rahaalivinaayak after crossing naumra ghaanghal in the morning and then ghatuli after crossing crooked paths
there is dispersion of unbridled huge boulders in the entire region
looking at it seems like that sometime in the past some big natural activity must have taken place here
in chhiplakot also we crossed ghanghals of this kind
if seen in geological map then lrb main central thrust rrb passes through these areas and it is very much possible that this form of nature came about because of this
reached nandakund after ghatuli
the expanse of the sarovar was huge but because of the melting of gull water content had decreased
even then nandakund had its own charm
from some villages around namik and munsyari nandajat comes here on the day of nandashtami
like gadhwal the festival of nanadpujan is celebrated with lot of fervor and enthusiasm in jauhar
on this occasion zonal fairs come together in milan and martauli villages
on this occasion people separated from their ancestral houses return to their origins
in the standing rocky area we reached the next mountain range with the help of track from where big parts of naamik and anargaal are visible
we were thrilled after nearing our aim
it was the sixth day of the journey
in the morning at only we left to see gull from our camps in namik bugyal
after climbing approximately we were at such spot where the undulating namik glacier comes before us in its entirety
sparkling in the first rays of the sun the glacier was delighting us till the limit of hypnotism
due to the cracks on the glacier it was not possible to cross it
neither was there way to climb up
therefore while balancing amongst moraines we descended down to zero point
there is no depressing expanse of moraines around naamik gull the one that we saw at gulls like chatrungi milam balaati panchachuli or bumraasa etc
in namik bugyal it got afternoon till the time we reached our camp and the weather had started to turn morose
first rain and then hail started coming
in while the peaks turned white
along with the fall in temperature in october snowfall is normal in this area
the fog emanating from ramganga spreading around us on all sides had covered namik gull and the summits around and we hid in our camps to escape from the cold
ramda had heard from his ancestors that years before british used to row boat like thing on snow lrb must be skiing rrb
since the time ramda told us this point question was continuously arising in my mind if there were any possibilities of brave tourism in the birth place of ramganga
now after seeing this area for maximum time we all mates of mountain group who reached here were of the same view that if the way from thalgawaar to namik gull is marked then trekkers can immensely enjoy the beauty of nandakund hiramani and namik
if few facilities can be developed here then the flux of tourists moving towards pindar can be turned towards this side and in next stages camping around balsan kund and skiing in thalagwar can be developed
this was our own belief
the question is of the thinking of the planners of the tactics of tourism development in uttrakhand
of identification of new places for the purpose of tourism and of decentralisation of tourism as well
bhotiya people reside near us only in many hamlets during winters
often when they came to the village they would discuss about tibet trade for sure
used to listen its tales from grandmother with much interest during childhood
with this the desire to see this places kept increasing
the information that the path to malari emerges from milam the frontier region of pithaurgarh was received after arrival at gopeshwar from ms snehlata joshi
she was appointed principal in girls school
when she came to gopeshwar for the first time then made mind to travel the border area on foot and in september took rudrasingh along from gopeshwar and reached malari
ahead from here is buransh hamlet where dhauli coming from neeti and girthi coming from unta dhara meet
in front of it in right in the middle of the two valleys is the kailahpur old village
dhauli valley towards the top becomes relatively flat
the land is worth farming
the roads and passes used for tibet trade are near
accordingly many villages of the tribe are settled here
farkiya baampa and gamshaali villages are situated on the left shore of dhauli kms above kailashpur
five kilometres ahead of gamshaali is situated neeti village
motor road is being made from buransh to neeti which till gamshaali is makeshift
at times jeeps etc are able to go there
due to excessive snowfall people stay here only during summers
on the other hand kms road has been constructed with geerthi gaad
can be visited only after taking permit
our journey is along girthi
rudrasingh and me had come from malari to buransh in the morning itself where we were waiting for vehicle for further ahead
the entire day had passed
at in the evening the truck agreed to move ahead
in distance of kms we reach metres above directly from metres
this journey kms from buransh was completed in hours
the army calls this place by the name of point
during the olden times it was called as brahmahatya
there is dwelling of the snake god in rampagat shepherd told so
folk tale is popular here that when the path was being paved here then the labourers had view of the snake god in the form of monkey
usually monkeys are not seen here but when they are seen then they are welcomed warmly
the way ahead of rampadhar was dangerous
the path was paved keeping in view the commutation of mules
in straight line below at depth of kms tributary of girthi was flowing noisily
the path would be little more wide than foot
on going at the edge dizziness was felt
little carelessness and the fear of falling in the deep gorge
the hill on which this path was paved was completely deserted and on the hill on the other side there were trees grown in scattered pattern
it is called seesa mountain
it is told that before there was thick forest on all four sides of seesa mountain primarily of kail
this forest got destroyed due to landslide from both the sides
around major destruction took place here
pond got made from the debris that came from landslide

here water was flowing from beneath the water
were moving ahead on the slope of unta dhura while paving way from freshly laid snow
we had reached unta dhura
winds blowing at dhura had increased in speed due to hide and seek by clouds
sat over there for some time
the feeling which was being experienced while sitting in this uninhabited but most beautiful place can not be stated in words
the hills that used to see since childhood from my village that time we were standing right behind them
the peak of nandadevi was on our right side
till manusyari now we had to descend on slope only
the weather was clear

landslide had erased the traces of the path ahead
crossed landslide taking risk
we reached dung after some time

arunachal is known for the most number of orchid species in india
craft center and other emporiums of market are filled with the souvenirs primarily art works colorful wooden utensils etc
buddhist works of art whether they are on canvas or on the wooden utensils looks very attractive and tourists naturally pine for them after looking at them
the vehicle going from tawang to tejpur reached bumdilla at around at night
all the employees of hotel la were present to help us board the vehicle
how intimate all of them had become in one day familiarity
the vehicle was full but we finally got to sit at the last seat
to sit in crowded bus while wearing blanket in icy winter is an enjoyable experience
with slow speed the bus is now on descent after crossing the heights of baumdilla that is baumdi pass
the dirang river flowing in dirang valley was sparkling in the full moon night
the ascent starts again from dirang

there is lot to see and to enjoy in taiwan which attract tourists towards it
today we are taking you to the national museum there where the history of eras is alive
tai pe museum in itself is collection of china taiwan and to large extent ancient indian art culture lifestyle and historical importance
in this three storied building everything has been treasured which gives form to the ancient history and taiwan and china
soon after entering this museum you can feel the life style of the th to st century from very close
were surprised then when written copper plates were kept in very large section
our guide le fung told us that these copper plates are of the times of shang dynasty
it is said that with this dynasty coming to rule the real history of china and taiwan begins
they had relations with india hun dynasty and these symbols have been kept in their memory
in this museum the series of the development of human society has been strung in very marvellous way
the glimpses of luxurious lifestyle of royalties and struggle filled lives of common man is clearly visible here
all the steps of education culture social religious and economic prosperity have been treasured in wonderful way in this museum
the pre historical journey of art culture and literature has also been underlined
after visiting the museum one feels the feeling of one complete asia continent
asia continent is the largest continent of the world
it expanse is crore lakh square miles
it covers one third portion of the entire world and is four times bigger than europe continent
during the journey of tai pe national museum it feels that despite high variation there is unity in asia
first of all asia is divided into sea and rivers
deserts and mountains in this continent also separate the countries from each other
in the entire asia there are various kinds political apparatuses and some of them are dramatically opposite to each other
the examples of china and taiwan are in front of us
where china has very capitalist and dictatorial views taiwan is completely democratic country
the thinking of taiwan is very close to that of india
the lifestyle gallery of museum makes us feel that in many aspects like lifestyle eating habits beliefs and behavior we are not in mutual agreement but despite this buddhism islam hinduism and sikhism which are spread in large part of asia have tied us together in many aspects
it has been shown in the art culture gallery of the museum that there were many similarities in the ancient civilisations of china mesopotamia babylonia and sindhu valley
it strange but even then it is an established fact that even centuries after the extinction of these civilizations we understand their contribution even today
even today these civilizations and their ruins string us in one bond
in this section only the economic development of taiwan has been shown by associating it with the rest of asia
historical evidence are testimony to this point that in past that there were mutual commercial relations among the asian countries and today we want to develop them continuously
as and by asia developed exploitation by the europeans also ended
in the historical section of the museum the social developmental stream of east asia lrb taiwan korea japan rrb south east asia lrb myanmar vietnam cambodia laos malaya sumatra java and philippines rrb and middle asia have been exhibited
the officials associated with the museum tell us that we people do not know much about the situation of china between to
on the basis of available records it is known that in around chinese society was feudalistic in nature and the entire china was under the control of feudal lords
on the other hand by the religious ruins of this period found in taiwanese area one comes to know that people here were very decent and god fearing
after this the prosperity series of the empires has been exhibited in which han dynasty lrb the first empire of china rrb tang dynasty sung royal family ming dynasty and manchu are included
the biggest speciality of this museum is this that whatever remains taiwanese researchers found in various countries besides taiwan they brought them along and submitted to the museum
this international museum not only exhibits the pre historic situations but associate them with the modern lifestyle as well
initially it was in very small form later in the government gave it new form and opened it for the public
since then continuous improvements are being done in it
the plain meaning of ice skating is to saunter on ice with the help of ice skates
these ice skates are special kind of shoes the blades attached to which helps you in galloping
if for some people ice skating is mode of tafrih then some play various amusing games with it help
the fun which it is to skate on frozen lake or river that is very difficult to describe in words
maximum fun of skating comes in games like bunday ice hockey ringette
in these very exciting games played on snow goals are to shot against the rival team with the help of sticks
bundae game is like football
there are players with every team of which one player is goalkeeper
in this game one has to deliver the ball in the opponent goalpost
the excitement of this game running in two halves of minutes each is heightened when seen
if talking about ice hockey then there is puck lrb instead rrb instead of ball
both the teams try to deliver this puck in the opponent goal post
in every team there are five skaters and one goalkeeper
the hangover of ice hockey is on the entire world but it is especially famous in countries like russia and canada
mainly women play ringette
in it rubber ball has to be sent in goalpost with the help of stick
in this game also every team has players
the specialists in skating set out on long trip on natural ice in group and call it ture skating
this trend is rising rapidly in sweden finland and norway
the most famous art of skating is figure or artistic skating
in the ice court marvellous scene is presented when couples roam on all sides hand in hand
anyone can be spellbound by looking at their footwork
couples drenched in merrymaking sway to and fro on snow and the clapping of audiences start reverberates in the hall
on the rhythm of music with flexibility of body months of practice is easily visible in this game
it is an olympic game which is exhibited as couple or in group
similar to it is synchronised skating
in it from to boys and girls in disciplined and harmonious way exhibit their art on ice in full speed
to entertain people by presenting oneself on ice is actually an arduous task
the feeling refused to leave
there is vehicle or an instrument in sledge riding with the help of which you can roam around on ice track
enjoy the experience of snow by sitting on it with your partner wo nt forget this for lifetime
in ski bobbing instead of ski wheels there is cycle like frame with the help of which covering snowy paths is enjoyed
in similar way snowmobile is vehicle to cover long distances of snowy paths there is place like chair to sit
snow has started to fall in the months of winter on hill stations of the country and the atmosphere is very pleasant
it is the best time for those who are besotted with snow games
places like kashmir gulmarg auli are the best for snow games during light winters
tourists from all over the nation come to himalayan valleys to see astonishing games of professional players on the snow laden high peaks
who would want to leave the opportunity of enjoying with snow games on now mountains so get ready for cold weather laced with energy
to look at the valleys of himalayas from auli nestled in the mountains of himalayas in the chamoli district of uttrakhand is comforting experience
this meadow situated in eastern gadhwal is at an approximate height of foot
to stare at surrounding mountain peaks of feet height gives very happy feeling
away from clamor and din auli will sooth and will also be exciting
auli is like heaven for lovers of skiing and professional and amateur players because the spiralling soft snow and shining slopes give them magical feel
auli is like school for novice where if they learn lessons of skiing then the slopes here also take their exam
kalinga war is believed to be the most frightening war in the indian history
it was after this war that there was change of heart of emperor ashoka and from being cruel ashoka he was known as dhammashoka meaning ashoka the follower of dharma
the mountain of dhauli around kms away from bhubhneshwar always freshens the memory of that two thousand year old battle and his conversion to buddhism as well
on the top of this very hill of dhauli is stupa then there are orders pertaining to ashoka period engraved on rocks
if this hill of dhauli had seen that war then it saw those post war activities also which ran on that hill after ashoka converted to buddhism
although shanti stupa made on the top of dhauli mountain is only years old which was made very late
but on its base at some time was aradhyavarti buddhist monastery
although the traces of kalinga war are not found today
but orders of ashoka can be seen on the rocks situated on the base of dhauli mountain
ashoka of the maurya dynasty was the most ambitious of all the brothers this is why his step brothers started to envy him
to sideline ashok they tried many failed attempts
whatever responsibilities father bimbasaar gave he was successful in them
this is why he became the most natural heir to bimbasaar to take his place
highly ambitious ashoka wanted the seat of patliputra which could not be acquired without finishing off brother sisuma
this is why when the maurya king died then to acquire the power of patliputra ashoka had to finish off his brother
after gaining the power of maurya empire he ran many missions to fulfil his dream of being victorious all over
due to him being powerful many kingdoms instead of fighting kept accepting his captivity
initially he won kingdoms near and far
before capturing kalinga his border had spread from today myanmar bangladesh in far east to pakistan afghanistan and iran in west
but kalinga was the only kingdom in the south of magadh which refused to accept ashoka captivity
his predecessors had also dreamt of winning kalinga because during the reign of king nanda kalinga was part of magadh only but soon after coup kalinga became an independent state
even bindusaar used to dream about winning kalinga
this is why the king of kalinga gave refuge to ashoka stepbrother then ashoka brows were raised
on this ashoka asked the king of kalinga to surrender
on rejection ashok attacked kalinga with huge army in which he was victorious
after being glorious with victory when emperor ashoka set out on tour of kalinga capital then for once he was confused on seeing the scene if it was his victory or defeat
on seeing houses turned to ruins on all four sides burnt half burnt buildings amputated dead bodies the injured waiting for death wailing children and women crying elderly people dead and injured animals blood laced roads
this was the first time when strong ashoka resolved to conquer all directions was troubled even after being victorious
those scenes and those things spent in ujjain buddhist monastery were coming repeatedly in front of his eyes where he was treated during the time he was injured
even after returning to patliputra from kalinga ashoka mind was not at peace
the falling of snow is romantic feeling and synonym to fun and frolic as well

village dudwa turned into debris after being completely buried under landslide
many people were buried alive
only one girl could be taken out alive from the debris in this dance of destruction all the remaining villagers died
man is performing destruction on mountains
last year itself one reason for destruction in the bangad area of tihri gadhwal lrb sikhdi village and nearby areas rrb kyaarki village of chamoli gadhwal was inefficient construction work
canal made on pautha village near sikhaadi village exposed the mask of the inefficient works of the irrigation department
the work was done with sand and gravel mainly in the canal instead of cement
which was uprooted in one rain splash only
when the canal broke then the dash of water moved ahead destroying pauntha village
pwd did nt remove the heavy debris lying on road directly above kyarki village kms ahead of gopeshwar headquarters of chamoli district in time
one shower of rain destroyed the entire city
the fast dashes of water along with all the debris gathered with high roars and noise then all the debris and water fell on the village
the speed at which uncontrolled constructions are on at illegal encroachments after depleting the forests in the holy spot of gangotri dhaam in utrakhand situated at height of metres above sea level and queues of toilets made of sackcloth have been laid on the banks of ganga disgrace has been brought upon the beauty of gangotri

gangotri temple bhagirath rock gaurikund waterfall etc here are worth visit and reverence
the birthplace of ganga gaumukh glacier is kms left from here
travellers and tourists reach till tapovana nandaban and mountaineering kedardom shivling summit
drinking water plan in this birthplace sector of ganga is destructive due to which stand posts here have dried today
these days people are coerced to drink water mixed with melting glaciers and mud sand stones
in totality the uselessness of the district administration is revealed in open in the crumbling travel arrangements in gangotri
the contrary reports that were coming about the situation of the lake built on bhagirathi as result of severe landslide near dabraani on the gangotri path around kms far from uttarkashi only misgivings are solidified and then it feels that preparation of catastrophe is going on the bhagirathi valley
although the pilgrims trapped on the gangotri road have been taken to safe spot eventually
gaumukh pilgrimage the origin place of ganga is the center of the devotion of religious pilgrims since one to two decades it has become spot of attraction and special fascination of nature lovers now every year more and more pilgrims and tourists have started to come to this area

the secretary of temple committee ramesh chandra semwal told that on earthquake night around pilgrims were in this dhaam
some travellers were in bhojwasa while returning from gaumukh journey which means that around one thousand travellers were in this area they told that the media publicised that passengers were trapped in gangotri that was basically said about the travellers trapped in gaumukh area

only few people were left in gangotri
due to the threat of possible danger some more went away
gangotri dhaam was deserted
the arrival of people towards gangotri began since november
by the time doors were closed people could reach here
exactly at doors of the temple were closed
on this occasion the soldiers of th gadhwal rifles who came from harsil played band and the palanquin along with hundreds of people moved towards mukhwa village lrb mukhimath rrb
on th november the palanquin reached mukhwa its winter seat
due to the gross tragedy of earthquake this time there was no excitement and chahal pahal and neither were tourists present on the occasion of door closing
the priests and employees of gangotri dhaam have given description of the destruction in their village mukhva by mentioning the destruction of temples and homes by sending memorandum to the government and administration and have also asked for the relocation of villagers at another place
the villagers told that the famous temple of mukhva has cracked and meter long crack has developed

in this way it will be easy for you to pack your stuff as per the weather there and you will not fall ill due to the change in season because body can not bear sudden change in temperature and due to this reason troubles like fever and cold take place
for places with warm climate keep cotton linen and loose fitting clothes
in hot and humid places clothes with light colors are good because instead of absorbing they reflect heat
knowing this that what kind of clothes people wear where you are going will ease your packing to large extent
taking long dresses sweaters and woollen sky pants is important at places with cold climate

also windcheater clothes with full arms gloves woollen caps covering ears will also save from the wrath of the weather
always remember this thing while packing that variety might be less in your suitcase but complete solution to save yourself from the wrath of the season should be there

actually had never been there before this
when was going for shooting from my hotel in car then very beautiful building was seen
asked my driver what it was so he replied buckingham palace

asked him again then he said that it was the back side of the palace
after this when again crossed the same place with my friend asked him the same question
he told me that it was station there
after this incident decided that before going anywhere will take complete knowledge of that place and will take that information from trustworthy person only
set out after taking care every thing and always check while going out if anything has been left or not
this advice will give to my friends as well
when go somewhere then really enjoy the popular things there and shopping
specially buy something or the other for my friends daughter
one more thing is always included in my shopping agenda
actually my feet are very large and shoes of their measurement are not found easily
this is why whenever go anywhere make sure to find shoes for myself
in our country kashmir is known as paradise because of its beauty
was planning to see this heaven from long time and finally accomplished it last year
really the land of kashmir is very beautiful and divinity has bestowed boundless love on it
staying in houseboat was like living dream
at that time it felt that if only time stopped then and keep living these moments
but there is grief about the fact that the time stayed amidst those beautiful valleys always felt fear and insecurity in the atmosphere there
the happiness which should have been there because of living in such beautiful place have never felt that before
rather always felt question in their eyes
this feeling will come to me by looking at heaven from so close had never thought it before
after returning from there am praying that the life of that beautiful place should also be exactly beautiful

the colorful city dubai alluring tourists is such dream of thousand of people which everyone wish to see
there is no doubt that dubai is capable of fulfilling every desire every aim every fascination and every kind of shopping of people
but since about one year dubai is struggling with legacy and modernisation because on one hand dubai government wants to treasure its ancient tradition and heritage of legacy and on the other hand also wish to stay ahead in every race of the world
in this race due to globalisation where the entire world has been affected there dubai economy has also creaked badly
cities apart dubai government has settled the world of buildings even in oceans
conditions were such that poor bachelors would roam here and there in search of single room
two and half years back such storm of rents was there in dubai that many bachelors used to sleep in their cars only
they would trade for bathing with families living in buildings in the morning and after working day long spend time here and there till late night like vagabonds and on feeling sleepy sleep in their car or on bench in park beneath the open sky
one room rent was three to three and half thousand dirhams in entire dubai
to take good flat in good locality was like golden dream
gradually staying alone also turning to be expensive they went to their own country
today the condition is such that in all directions vacant buildings and flats are visible
the rates of new houses is about thousand to thousand dirham and the rent of houses is also halved
this procedure no doubt affected the economy of dubai along with empty houses empty flats and tall buildings are in search of clients
initially there was visa of dirhams to go to dubai
for an urgent visa more dirham were to be paid
this visa was valid for months
if somebody wanted to increase it for one more month then in dirhams he she would get again visa for one month
taking new visa again in dirhams after two months many people were able to stay again for two months going to kish lrb iran rrb
but there is no such arrangement now
now there is visa for one month two months or three months whose only charge is dirhams
for people taking visa in black one month visa also costs to dirhams
even transit visa costs dirhams
plying of people and visiting also reduced because of this reason
initially eating out in dubai was very inexpensive
but today from the price of food to every other thing has doubled now
this is why the atmosphere of shopping has turned cold now
before coming on vacation every person would do shopping for thousands
but now because of double inflation people prefer shopping here only after coming back to india
also in the beginning declaration were made of attractive gifts with shopping
somewhere cars then somewhere heaps of gold and somewhere other attractive things
but in this period of economic recession the exhibition of all these things has stopped
before people used to shop in the lure of prizes and things specially during eid and festivals people shopped extensively
but now gifts have also disappeared and prizes are also lost in the darkness of anonymity

after getting out of nagpur station its hard to imagine that few hours away from here is an ancient and dense forest where the animals considered as dangerous roam freely even today
you can reach kanha national park in six hours from either nagpur or jabalpur road way
from both the cities government bus runs which goes till the place named kisli in the core zone lrb inner part rrb of kanha
there are three gates to go to the preserved area of kanha
one of them is kisli
there is one petrol pump and ten fifteen houses in kisli leaving the baghira log hut of the madhya pradesh tourism and dormitery
here you would see deers and baboons more than humans
five kilometers away from kisli is khatiya village where more tourists halt
caravan of jeeps starts for the kisli village in the morning and waits at the gate
the journey of kanha starts with the first ray of the sun
there are many fields of wild grass between this jungle of sal and bamboo which give familiar look to this unusual scene
till the morning fog disappears kanha bathed in the soft light soaks the city concerns of the people sitting in the jeeps
in the bigger animals you would first of all see deer of many species
the main among these is the stag for whose protection kanha is famous
the jeep reaches the dense forests running over raw paths crossing many small ditches
the trees of different species and the different birds hopping and making noise on these become the background of the safari now
wild boars can be seen here grazing fearlessly
the male boar can be heavy till ton
looking at their white hoofs it seems as if this huge creature is roaming wearing socks
but the animal which pulls people from all over the world to kanha that is the tiger
to see tiger in kanha the patience to stay here and the swiftness to start with the first ray of the sun is must
one tiger roams in the area of ten kilometers and being the main predator of the jungle likes to move stealthly
getting glimpse of the tiger the deer peacock and the baboon cry out their calls to caution others to recognize which among the many other voices in the jungle is an art
the guide on the jeep and the driver predict the location of the tiger by these danger signals and the paws imprints on the tracks
if the guide and the driver with you are adept and if they have good mutual coordination then you can reach near tiger but to get its glimpse depends completely on the tiger
if you are coincidently on its way and it decides to pass from near you then along with fear and excitement you would produce respect in the mind for this royal animal
keeping the tourists in mind tiger show by the elephant is also organised
group of mahouts start early at four in the morning on the look out and report to the ranger spotting tiger
if the ranger find it right then the mahouts take the tourists on the elephant backs near the tiger
along with the splendor of wild life the natural beauty of kanha has given birth to many stories and legends
you would know the reason of this reaching from the uneven routes to kanha highest plateau bamni dadar
an untouched image is visible from the field till the sky from this huge grassland in the middle of the jungle
this plateau is so big that before coming under the protected area small planes used to land here
the retreating sun sets here in green ocean
rudyard kipling mowgli perhaps did nt return to the modern civilization impressed with this spectacle itself
if you wish to come to kanha from the city via train or bus then along with tourism make introduction with nature your goal
the jungles in india are depleting and the future of kanha depends on our awareness and the government vigilence
it is rare experience in the twenty first century to exhibit wild tiger roaming in its natural habitat how important it is to secure this you would understand only when you come to kanha
yes you would get glimpse of it in these pictures

once they even surprised the mughals attacking the red fort
the many things brought from the red fort as the sign of victory can still be seen in the palaces of deeg
this little town of rajasthan although is part of brijbhoomi and is situated on the way to govardhan parikrama but the reason of its popularity among the tourists are the forts palaces gardens and fountains here
after king badan singh his son surajmal extended deeg and got many grand buildings constructed
the main builting of deeg is the magnificent fort

it is evident that there is an abundance of pyramids here
but it seems the whole truth of this world is yet to come before us
archaeologists have discovered another pyramid below the sands of sakkara
the area of sakkara has been excavated very less so far
however several undiscoverd pyramids have been found here in recent years
it is said that the recently found pyramid is years old and it was built several hundred years after the great pyramids of giza
this pyramid is said to be of queen mother sesheshet of the founder of the sixth dynasty
this queen had played important role in the establishment of the sixth dynasty by bringing two mutually quarelling branches of the dynasty together
the pyramids of egypt tells us the stories of the civilization and magnificent architecture of thousands years ago when it was considered that any king becomes the king of the dead just after dying and some part inside him still keeps on fulfilling the responsibilities as king
therefore his body was transformed into mummies and kept in the pyramid with all those facilities which he might have needed
the statues of servants were also made to stand inside the pyramid
this fresh discovery took place in the graveyard of kings of memphis the capital of ancient royalty of egypt kilometres south from giza
buried under the metres of sand only five metre high cubic part was remaining
there was so much of sand deposited here that no one even expected what is lying beneath
excavation work was on here for last two years but just two months ago it got determined that the structure with length and breadth of metres is in fact the base of pyramid
they also found the parts of white limestone which once must have been applied on the whole of the pyramid
with the same they also got the help that the pyramid would have been metres high
this is th pyramid discovered in egypt that is an increase by one in the excuses to go to egypt
the first pyramid of egypt is also said to have been built in sakkara itself in before christ
this was said to be highest building at that time after that the popularity of this kind of pyramids grew

this island was first discovered by count de maunytalvande the self declared progeny of one of the generals of napolean who had come to ceylone along with tea king thomas lipton for the first time in
he was so impressed by the beauty of srilanka that after the first world war he came there again to look for world of his dreams for himself it took him ten years
in he found this island and built monument the structure of which was unique with the point of view of european style as if you were in cruise boat
count mauny stayed there for thirty years and during that period he hosted many well known personalities of the world
interesting thing is that prior to that this island was considered to be cobradump because in srilanka people do not kill snakes therefore all the cobras caught were left on this island
even after the death of the count it kept on drawing many people towards itself
many people made it their home for some period
but gradually people started forgetting it
in the year of its present owner took it in his hands and today this is considered among the most romantic inns of the world
there are five suites in the octagonal hotel with white floor and high roofs of wood on the island
in each of the suites there are drawing room verandah and enough open space besides bedrooms giving straight view of the sea
each bedroom has its own roof from where one gets the view of the largeness of the indian ocean
the central room of the building is thirty feet high in which there is full arrangement for the natural light and air to come
the furniture of the building will take you to an era hundred years back
infinity swimming pool is like bathing in the endless sea
there is jungle like garden spread around the building in which you can also enjoy things like losing lrb within yourself rrb on desolate island
taprobane island is just in the middle of the weligama bay merely yards away from the southern tip of srilanka
from the international airport of colombo it is four and half hour journey by road
but if you wish to enjoy the adventure bit more and go by helicopter or seaplane then the journey remains for mere one hour
the water is not very deep from the coast therefore reaching the island has different joy
this southern coast of srilanka is new attraction for the tourists throughout the world because here one gets the same view experience and ambience that is found in maldives of thailand
you will also be surprised to know that between this island and the southern pole there is nothing except unfathomable ocean
the time from november to april is the best to go here because because these days it does not rain here
but many people also go here to enjoy rains
the fare of the suite here is dollar per night in the month of august and between january to april
at the same time from september till december and then again from may till july the fare comes down to remain at dollar per night

when the wet weather of the rains is about to go light winter is in preparation to come by

tourists have already gone to this place several times
they know that due to increasing population army of vehicles depleting public facilities one does not get the same joy which should come after coming from such afar spending so much of time and money
what should the government also do it keeps extremely busy with saving its head and running its cars that is why several such places get left behind where tourists can enjoy naturally if little preference is given and advertised

bhojpur located kilometres away from bhopal the capital of madhya pradesh is famous for magnificent and colossal shiva temple and jain temple
this shiva temple located in the obedulla ganj development block of the goharganj subdivision of raisen district was built in the th century by king bhoja the first of the parmar dynasty lrb ad rrb
this specimen of high quality of architecture built on the banks of the betwa river was built with the help of chief architect of king bhoja and other scholar architects
it is also called bhojeshwar temple
the largeness of this temple can be estimated with the fact that its platform is metre lrb feet rrb long metre lrb feet rrb wide and metre lrb feet rrb high
built with heavy stones this platform is unique in itself
the sanctum sanctorum of the shiva temple has been built by raising many stones of several tons on this platform
the sanctum sanctorum is square metre lrb square feet rrb from outside and square metre lrb square feet rrb from inside
the large shivlinga in the temple is located on the gauri platform built metre lrb feet rrb high
shivlinga is metre lrb feet rrb high and its periphery is of metre lrb feet rrb
it is considered by some people as the highest shivlinga of india
to enter the sanctorum there is metre high and metre wide gate
this temple is the signature of the great personality and foresightedness of king bhoja
bhoja father sindhu king was killed at the hands of chalukya king telpa in the south godavari river it is believed that king bhoja had built the shiv temple in his memory the design of which is called swargarohanprasad
bhoja built many temples
there is beautiful jain temple at distance of one kilometre from the shiva temple
like the shiva temple it is also incomplete
king bhoja is mentioned on the edicts there
there are statues of jain tirthankaras in the temple
according to the literature available at the local level the main statue among them is that of tirthankar shantinath while it has been called as the feet high statue of lord mahavira in the website of state tourism and raisen district
at some other places it has been written as the statue of adinath
according to the archaeological department there are two small statues of parshwanath and suparshwanath on both the sides of the main statue
this region is related to sage mantungacharya the creator of bhaktamar hymn
his monument is built here
the pleasant view around provides peace of the soul
bhoja had started school to give expertise in architecture for the training of the architects
but due to sudden death of the king both the work of shiva temple in its last stage and the school got closed
even the incomplete temple is so magnificent that the experts say that if it was completed it would have been unparalleled
by some historians it is also called the somnath of the east
later the local people also started collecting stones of the platform according to their needs and also caused some damage
besides this in th century the sultan of mandu hoshang shah invaded and caused heavy damage to the platform and the temple
the dam and lake that was built by king bhoja with the help of expert engineers they were also heavily damaged and the water system was brought into titters
in fact two colossal dams built with stones are also counted among the achievements of king bhoja
it is said that the lake was surrounded by hills all the sides and the way was from only two places one of hundred yards and another of five hundred yards
bhoja had bound the lake by building dam with stones
the smaller dam was feet high and three hundred feet thick from below
the bigger dam was feet high and hundred feet wide
together both the dams used to stop the water of the lake spread in square miles
story in the gond tribe tells that when hoshang shah broke the smaller dam then it took the whole of his army three months to break it
after the breaking of the dam it took three years for the water to dry out and till further thirty years that land was not worth residence
it is said that due to this lake drying up the weather of malwa changed forever
there was time when the bhojeshwar temple at the fag end of the lake spread from bhojpur to bhopal was seen standing
the stone that was used to in building the temple was achieved from the rocky areas of bhojpur itself
near the temple and afar the ruins of cutting of rocks can be seen even today
according to vidya dahejia the writer of early stone temples of orissa there is similarity seen in building the shiva temple of bhojpur and ling raj temple of bhuvaneshwar and some other temples
shivlinga is metre lrb feet rrb high and its periphery is of metre lrb feet rrb
because the cave is on the other side of the river therefore to go across the river boats are available
though the famous shiva temple of bhojpur is standing in the desolate rocky area but there is no dearth of devotees
each year huge fair takes place here
reach bhopal through air or rail ways from any corner of the country
the distance of bhojpur from bhopal is kms
private vehicle is more appropriate for tours
get down at bhojpur running on the bhopal mandideep road from the bus stand
the fare takes rupess per person
take tempo for the temple from there
its fare is also rupess per person
there is no place for staying in the temple or nearby bhopal would be appropriate for stay
the talk of the beauty of sikkim is common
but here we are talking of the place which has achieved the fame of the most beautiful village of sikkim
the name of this village is lachung
this status was given to it by the roamer joseph dalton hooker in the himalayan journal published in
but even without that seal of joseph dalton this village is interesting
this is very near the border of china in north sikkim
lachung is located at height of feet on the confluence of lachen and lachung rivers
these rivers merge with tista river ahead
cold is throughout the year at such height
but if it has snowed then its beauty gets novel dimension taking photos of which you can decorate in your drawing room
therefore people come in the weather of cold also pretty much
besides natural beauty the particular thing about sikkim is that even with snow fall this area remains as much accessible
if accessibility is easy then there is nothing but joy of touring
peaks laden with snow waterfalls rivers twinkling like silver mesmerise the tourists coming here

therefore the arrangement for vehicle has to be done locally
after the start of border trade between india china the communication of tourists have also increased in this area
prior to this in even before china occupation over tibet lachung used to function as the trade square between sikkim and tibet
later this area remained closed for common people for long time
now along with situation becoming normal at the border tourists have again started going there
therefore many hotels have also been built there

orchha has got the status of second ayodhya
here ramraja is present in his child form
it is hearsay that sri ram here rest here by the day and in ayodhya at night
after evening aarti his flame is submitted to hanumanji who takes him to ayodhya for night rest
it is mentioned in the scriptures that the primitive manusatrupa had penanced for thousands of years to achieve sheshshayi vishnu in the childform
being pleased vishnu blessed her and incarnated as rama in treta krishna in dwapar and ramaraja of orccha in kaliyug
thus madhukar shah and his wife ganeshkunwari were incarnations of dashrath and kaushalya
in treta dashrath could not coronate his son this wish of his also got fulfilled in kaliyug
there is an enchanting story of ramraja coming to orccha from ayodhya
one day the orchha king madhukarshah asked her wife ganeshkunwari to go to vrindavan with the intent of worshipping krishna
but the queen was devotee of rama
she declined to go to vrindavan
in anger the king asked her if you are such big devotee of rama then go and bring your rama to orccha
reaching ayodhya the queen building cottage near the laxman fort on the banks of sarayu river started her prayer
these days the great sage tulsidas was also busy in prayer in ayodhya
getting blessings from the sage the prayer of the queen got firmer and firmer
but the queen could not get to see ramraja for several months
being frustrated finally she jumped into the middle of the saryu to leave her life
here in the unfathomable depths of the water she got face to face with rajraja
the queen told him of her intent
ramraja accepted to go to orccha but he put up three conditions first this journey would be on feet second the journey will be only in pushpa nakshatra third the statue of ramraja will not move again from the place where it is placed once
the queen sent the message to the king that she is coming to orccha with ramraja
to install the statue of ramraja madhukarshar built the chaturbhuj temple at cost of crores
when the queen reached orccha then she kept this temple in her palace
it was decided that at the auspicious time the statue will be kept and inaugurated in the chaturbhuj temple
but this statue of rama denied to go to the chaturbhuj temple
it is said that rama came here in child form and how could he leave the palace of the mother and go to the temple
ram is present in the same palace even today and the chaturbhuj temple built at cost of crores is still desolate
this temple is still devoid of statue
it is also coincidence that the day of samvat ramraja came to orccha the same day the writing of ramcharit manas also got completed
it is said about the statue that is present in orccha that when ram was going for exile then he gave one child statue of his to mother kaushalya
mother kaushalya used to offer bal bhoga to the same
when ram came back to ayodhya then kaushalya offered this statue in the sarayu river
ganeshkunwari found this statue in the middle of the sarayu river
this is the lone temple of the world where ram is worshipped as king and he is offered salutes before the sunrise and after the sunset
here rama is considered as the king of orccha
there are temples of hanumanji all around the ramraja temple
temples of chhadadari hanuman hanuman of bajaria lanka hanuman are all around in the form of security circle

sangdaah is very famous for famous environmentalist kinkri devi
normal food is available here that too if you reach on time then
we had set out after taking breakfast and had reached taking our own time
the fragrance of potato parathas coming from shop in front of us beckoned us
it was quite joy eating pranthas filled with ginger garlic green chilly coriander with fresh curd
from here the road ascends for haripurdhar lrb km rrb
the expansive greenery on the serpentine hilly paths move along with us
on halting among deep gorges various kind of trees chirping of birds attractive stones and in the company of blue sky it feels like that if at times there are picnics in life then fun will be continued
we reached haripurdhar while imbibing the clean clear and healthy air of rhododendron kail deodar trees
it is small hilly town
there is better arrangement for lodging and fooding here
it was evening and time for tea so when drank ginger tea then as if the body was recharged
the main attraction of haripurdhar is the temple of the powerful bhangyaani ma two km away from the main market
on climbing around steps when we reached the courtyard of the temple then we felt as if it is quite cold here
it was decided to lodge in temple premise itself
after drinking tea we started to stroll all around the temple but the heart was restless to go inside the quilt
there was time for the meal to get ready
outside the kitchen on bonfire the local residents who came from punjab and haryana were warming up their bodies
while talking it was known that haripurdhar at foot is situated at even more height than shimla lrb foot rrb
the highest mountain peak lrb feet rrb of southern himachal choorhdhar lrb choodhchaandani rrb is visible from here
trekking for eight hours one can reach there
this spot is believed to be the penance place of lord shiva and one of his twelve residences
according to the saga of shirgul mahadev famous in folk stories when he went to delhi with hundreds of haati then the delhiites were left surprised by his miraculous acts
the area surrounding choorhdhar mountain is also wildlife sanctuary and many medicinal herbs are also found there
story is also like this that hanumanji found sanjivani herb here
the water here is more clean than mineral water which when drunk quench thirst and also increase appetite
the morning of haripurdhar was an example
after praying in temple when we reached the courtyard the right in front of us the snow laden himalayan range was seen spread till far
as and when light began to spread our eyes began to get busy in imbibing the changing dimensions of intoxicating beauty of the snow spread on charming himalayas
the sun continued to dominate and himalayas in front of us kept changing colors and becoming more alluring
how much time was spent we did nt come to know
on seeing himalayas in front of us we felt as if coming here was successful
when we began to take stroll in haripurdhar then we felt as is mother nature has created nature with an open heart
wherever our eyes went everything looked panoramic winsome enchanting

the simplicity and devoted hospitality of the workers there in temple premises won our hearts
the journey of haripurdhar considered little brave journey was one step ahead not behind the journeys of very popular tourist spots
in one glance haripurdhar is kilometres from nahan
buses go till dadahu
jeeps also ply till andheri
there are few sources further but if personal vehicle is there then no problem is there
in haripurdhar situated at height of meters above sea level even during summers weathers cools down in evening

world third highest peak kanchenjunga is also here whose golden beauty of sunrise leaves deep imprint on the viewers
it is clear that under the shadow of such mountain there are many areas present for trekking from the ordinary to high trekking in whichthe stamina of tourists on foot is tested
otherwise in sikkim said to be the nature own garden and the region of flowers many rivers and snowy regions are located at many places in all directions for other brave activities but the thrill of high trekking in western sikkim is different
yuksam has stayed the first capital of sikkim whose height above sea level is foot
base camps are put here only for treks like jogri jemathang and ascent on kanchenjunga due to which the significance of western sikkim increases
many other treks also begin from here
some time before the tourism department of sikkim government had organised national high altitude trekking program in which trekking groups from many parts of the country participated
when our group set out from delhi then stayed at darjeeling for two days where international himalayan mountaineering meet was organised
we attended it
apart from great mountaineers like sir edmund hillary and his wife his mountaineer son peter hillary tenzing norgay nwang gombu his daughter rita gombu fu dorjee we also met some mountaineers of italy and spain
from darjeeling we moved towards sikkim
our bus crossed rangit river which determines the border of west bengal and sikkim
in peling we stayed for night
maximum mates enjoyed the consumption of local intoxicant named rakshit
the next day we were in yuksam
like normally it is important on going at any place with altitude lrb thousand foot above rrb we had to stay here for two days acclimatise ourselves
there is an overbearing influence of leech in this area full of dampness and moisture
they can be found from an open area to even in your bed
to safeguard from them we were given salt to put in our shoes
even then it is only probability that someone remains untouched from their attack
nearby at an elevated spot is an ancient buddhist monastery
on the second day we went there and on return we got together for the preparation of going on trekking the next day
on putting salt in our shoes we set out for our first halt soka
there were flowers at many places on the beautiful plants of rhododendron through which we kept moving ahead
on seeing forest somewhere and the flow of water at other places we would forget our tiredness
met yaks as well on the way
before evening descended we had reached soka
when we began to walk for our next halt jongari then rain came and surrounded us
heavy rains increased our problems
as we were moving ahead foliage was decreasing
only rhododendron flowers were seen more
post noon we had reached jongri
there snowfall took place
all around there was snow and cold was also more
the arrangement of tea and food was of government everywhere and there was no need for us to make food but due to the effect of height there was no desire to eat anything
sleeping at night also became difficult
next morning some members were hesitating from moving ahead
but with courage all moved together
because of no practice of trek at high altitudes how the lack of oxygen can be fulfilled had no knowledge about it
while moving towards thhanjing we saw grand view of narsingh mountain and pandim peak
the shine of snow on both the mountains in the glittering sunshine was not letting us stare at it for long
it did nt take us much time to reach the destination spot because we were going little below the height of jongri and distance was also not much
in sikkim sumiti lake is also called as mini maansarovar

the next morning we had our breakfast and then after resting for while we began trekking
unfortunately the effect of height was beginning to be felt by me
not even one step ahead could walk
some mates tried to give me support but could not walk
kept sitting and the members of first group and then the vice captain of the group and then the captain also moved ahead quietly
in the end the most slow walking two members dr yadav and professor yadav came to me
taking my condition seriously both of them halted there
there was porter also with them
firstly dr yadav made me drink lot of sweetened drink so that through water the level of oxygen increase my body
then they made me sleep
around one hour kept sleeping and they kept sitting beside me
finally they decided that should be taken back to thhanjing
dr yadav and porter carried me till the camp bearing difficulties
professor shekhar kept moving ahead gradually so that dr yadav meet him again
it was night already
doctor and porter set out towards lampokhari after carrying me till camp
camp leader arranged five porters by giving information here and there by wireless set and next day those porters one by one took me to soka camp through some shorter way by carrying me on their back
here due to less height my situation began to improve
was grateful to those porters who helped me in such situation
hilly people are known for such helpful nature as well
after spending night in lampokhari my mates came to kasturi aural and reached yuksam from soka
next day all members came together as well
all narrated their own stories and problems and celebrated the happiness of the completion of trekking mission
before beginning trekking we had seen female member from group that had come from mumbai get unwell
