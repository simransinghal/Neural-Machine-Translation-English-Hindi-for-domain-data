prayag is called the king of pilgrimages
in the puranas the story regarding prayag being called the pilgrimking is also found
there is story among all the gems that came out during the samudra manthan elixir also came out to achieve which the gods and the demons began to compete
the drops of elixir fell on the earth at four places
first in prayag then nasik ujjain and in haridwar
since then till today kumbh and ardhkumbh fairs are organised at all these four places at times
according to story brahma and rishis questioned sheshnag regarding prayag being the king among pilgrimages
on being told by sheshnag brahma put all the pilgrimages and saptpuris on one side of libra and only prayag on the other but the scale shifted towards prayag and then prayag status as the king of pilgrimages was established
it is said that the moment person enters the border of this area then at every step he gets the result equivalent to one ashwamedha yajna
all the pilgrimages of the world has come out of prayag prayag has not come out of other pilgrimages that is why prayag is called the king of pilgrimages
according to the padmapuran the way the world is created out of the universe universe does not arise out of the world in the same way the other pilgrimages have arisen out of prayag
in the prayag district capital of maharshi yayati pratisthapur and the ashram of the guru of lord shri krishna and sudama sandipani are situated
lord buddha had given the sermons of buddhism for several years in this very city and emperor ashok had erected one of his pillars in the king of pilgrimages prayag itself which is present even today
aadiguru shankaracharya had also visited here and his meeting with kumaril bhatta ready for selfimmolation in the woodfire also occurred here
it is believed that aadi shankaracharya had given the magh fair of prayag the form of national festival
on the day of new moon of magh sun and moon remains in the capricorn at the same degree of the earth
that is why in order to get salvation it is important to take bath and perform yagna in the month of magh especially on the day of new moon
magh fair is held in prayag every year
every sixth year ardhkumbh and every twelfth year kumbh is held
the kumbh fair in prayag is held three years after the haridwar kumbh fair and there is three year difference between the kumbh fairs of prayag and nasik but the kumbh of nasik and ujjain are celebrated in the same year
sometimes the kumbha of nasik takes place before ujjain
kumbha festival cycle is as follows
the kumbh festivals of all the four places have been related with the astrological calculation and the main dates of bathing
there have been different opinions of various scholars regarding the kumbh cycle
some scholars fix kumbh festival in the twelfth year itself
according to the second opinion the auspicious time of kumbh does not occur until the astrological conjunction does not form
if the equation of the other planets do not agree then the kumbh festival can take place in the eleventh and the thirteenth year also
this kind of situation arises because of the western effect of jupiter and the time of its revolution around the sun
jupiter plays an important role in deciding some festivals
from the point of view of the division of time from among nakshatras and sun signs and planets the th sun sign is the aquarious
aquarius is an aquatic sun sign
saturn is the boss
saturn is the air element
water and air this is the environment
sun earth fire elements obviously have importance
the kumbh of haridwar is symbolic of this very sun sign
one day of gods is equivalent to the one year of the humans
this is the reason why according to the serial order of the position of the planets kumbh festival is celebrated at four places in the twelfth year
this festival itself is the synonym of the fair
it becomes clear from the study of the puranas that the kumbha festival and the ganges have special relationship
ganga is obviously there in prayag
the godavari of nasik is also confluence
it is known by the name of gautami
shipra becomes eastward from the place where it was once hugged by ganga
linga named gangeshwar there is worshipped by ganga

the imagination of eating food sitting on decorated tables there was thrilling in itself
all around across glass we could see remarkable kind of small and big fishes corals humans doing snorkelling and scuba diving
this room was actually dining room
while descending down in sea water through stairs many metres below we reached in such room of glass water which was inside water
we had not even been able to make oursleves easy with the nature around that we reached such place was unimaginable
while going on to the main island from jetty the scene of life on both the sides of bridge was marvellous
sauntering on conrad road can be done on foot as well as through battery operated car
association was also not such that finding something with beauty or luxury like that would be difficult outside
in such world that had no association with any outside world
but on reaching conrad resorts of hilton hotels on rangali siland it felt as if we reached in some other world
that flight was breathstopping one with thrill and enthusiasm
this beauty of water will not be found anywhere else
to see thousands of resorts and coral islands scattered in sea from the sea plane flying till the height of around thousand metres was unforgettable
we were to go to one hundred five kilometres far rangali island by the sea plane of trans maldivian
but then there was no likelihood that we would get chance to ride in it
we had seen so many pictures of it
last evening when cruise was nearing male then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing from above
from there while circling around runway we reached on the base of trans maldivian
in the morning one boat brought us to airport island from the cruise
there was hunch that the day was going to be special
this is why was waiting restlessly for the next day
every thing about maldive was overwhelming
got to know this as well that president at times reaches his office two blocks ahead crossing roads on foot
can you think of this about the house of petty leader in india
with much pleasure we were clicking photographs by extending our hand from inside the gate of the bungalow at distance of mere fifty kilometres
could not believe that we were in front of the residence of the supreme persona of certain country no security guard till far
little while before listening to president nasheed speech we were standing outside his government residence
to this point that you will find coral even on stones on graves
coral reef is the life here
while returning to mv aquamarine the two hours of evening spent in maley were roaming in our mind
if you are able to see clear even some centimetres in the water of ocean or river abutting to any city of india then will find yourself lucky
this was that part of the ocean which was right next to the city
the water was so clear that fishes swimming below in depth of many metres were visible in all their colors in the light of lamppost
while returning towards the jetty to go back to cruise after that stroll of market when the gaze suddenly went in the water of ocean moving along side the road then felt that to what extent people here understand the value of beauty here
as if so much of beauty does not gather in this tiny country
something as special is tehre in the beauty there
many people might have considered the meeting held underwater by the cabinet of maldive facade but on going to maldive it feels that if natural calamity snatch it from us then the world will become so poor
but when there is question of the very existence of unique creation of earth then this much seriousness was incumbent upon
if say with honesty then have never seen any indian hear speeches of presidents or prime ministers so carefully
all salesmen were listening carefully the speech given by president mohammad nasheed in world climate conference day before in copenhagen
we were in the largest antique and souvenier shop of the capital in ahmadi market of male
sea plane do journey of kilometres to kilometres lrb mavilevaru in north rrb in the islands of maldive
and that is one such journey that your heart will never approve of its end
if you go to some other island separate from male island then journey of sea plane would be important this is the only mode of journey amidst various islands
if you want then in around four thousand rupees lrb per person rrb you can do air tour for an hour or can hire complete sea plane for day long roaming around lrb only if your pocket is heavy rrb
trans maldivian is one of them which has sea planes
there are only two sea plane companies in maldives
everything is visible so clearly
all the time your eyes keep looking down out of the window gazing at resort islands of maldives in blue water of different shades and coral islands
in the entire flight you do not feel the experience of ordinary flights
one does nt come to know when it rise in air while running like speed boat on the surface water
but this twin otter plane of seats is undoubtedly the best for sightseeing an archipelago lrb island group rrb like maldives
while roaming in huge airplanes if suddenly one sea plane stands in front of you then it will look like toy plane to you
on reaching capital male according to your pocket you can enjoy available entertainments activities from sea plane ride to underwater lunch
entertainment is along everytime
in the fare of cruise tea snacks meals everything is included
what else is needed
if two elders are there then children less then years of age absolutely free
which means three day fair for one person is even less than rs thousand
on the plane mv aquamarine of louis cruise you can go on three day cruise for the tour of maldive at rate of minimum rs per person per night
although due to some problems lui cruise has postponed its services now but there is hope of them resuming october onwards
louis cruise is an european company and is very famous in cruise and hotel industry
in the first week of december louis cruise has begun the only see cruise of india from cochhi for maldive and colombo
sea cruise are proved profitable here only
after that if you halt at male even then hotels can be found at less rent but to enjoy the beauty of maldives if you go to any island around then the pocket willprove small
if seen in today date then for maldive from delhi the most inexpensive return fare is of thousand rupees per person

wherever the bus stops come back in time
during this time do not leave your stuff on the seat because bus officials do not take its responsibility on its loss
during the cleaning of bus everyone is asked to go out of the bus
in this way you will get much important information from them
establish familiarity with the bus driver and conductor
if there is facility of washroom in the bus then do take care of this while chosing the seat because after while it becomes difficult to sit there
if there is not much crowd in the bus then the planning will be successful
if you are looking for capturing both then sit on the corner sit early and keep your bag on the second one
now point of craftiness
if you have to go to toilet frequently then take the corner seat and if you do not like to get much distrubed then window seat will be better for you
you will experience more bumps at the back seat and reading at front seat is not comfortable
mind comfort while chosing seat
actually the early you reach the better seat options you will have

whre you have to take bus from reach there an hour before time
also take care of the point that during the tour while changing the bus responsibility of luggage will be your own
because they fit in racks above the seat
carry on bags are good take them
also also learn about the rules of insurance or loss coverage from the tour company
it might not happen that some luggage has to be left at the terminal or extra fee has to be paid
rules are strict regarding baggage this is why enquire about the size and weight of luggage
they are inexpensive
instead of two way trip enquire about round trip
buying ticket in advance is cheaper this is why it is better to plan little early than planning bus tour in last moments
students senior people of ministry kids etc get discount on it then arrangement of discount for two people is also there
before buying ticket search for the best deal
this is the reason that to enjoy them there are some points to be taken care of specially then when you are seeing some foreign destination through bus tour
yes this much is there that along with giving less expense and plenty of time filled with comfort these tour demand patience out of you for sure
not only this in this journey you can give lot of time without disturbing your favorite book

there is different joy of bus tour
although it looks little difficult on thinking but such tours are actually interesting and provide with very different kind of experience
actually the motive of such tours is to bring tourists face to face with the life style ways and traditions of that place
apart from this care is taken on serving traditional cuisine as well
along with where old tourists sites etc are also present
this way there is an attempt to explore such places where much development has not taken place and cinsiderable effect has not been on the nature and lifestyle of people
lodging meals etc are alo included in it
these tour are usually prepared for time period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places
woithout doubt and this this happens not in one but many nationsand tourist show much interest also in them

aman bag way of bidding farewell was also traditional they bid us farewell by making us eat jaggery and curd
this is million dollar priceless moment
early morning had seen tourist from holland sitting in deep meditation
after this we reached bhaangadh by jeep
such glimpse of village life was wonderful experience for jackie
this year it did nt rain but first time saw tobacco farming
saw dry lake in which farmers were farming
while walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of ajabgadh on which rays of sun were spreading gradually
first of all walk with ram babu and the jeep journey of bhaangadh
manager fixed our program for the morning
everything is new but artisitc it was not surprising that aman bagh has received an award recently
themost beautiful is its lighting
everything is inspired from forts and palaces
my host jackie who has been decorator uttered suddenly this is interesting
we reached at sunset and we made mind of taking round of that garden
along with binding mauli in the wrist the mantra of mangalachar is chanted live
the moment you enter inside the way you are welcomed it appears from that only that here attention has been paid to divine peace
the first glimpse of aman bagh surrounded with mountains and under the shadow of dense trees allure your heart
its old wall is the witness of those days
it construction was done in nineteen hundred and twenty
this is the only left garden among those seven gardens where the kings of alwar used to camp for hunting
this time reached there suddenly at feast by foreign guest so felt that those people who want to spend fantastic holiday in less time should come here for sure
it different matter that she herself reached bhaangadh after losing way
remember that night as well when shabana azmi had called me from all her heart there but could not go
after the opening of aman bagh big personas of our nation and abroad reached here
among the ones spending holidays in rajasthan in royal way how many would have visited bhaangadh of ghosts why should go far among jaipurites as well perhaps only one or two must have spent night there
this garden also has its own history and the best point is it introduces you to the nearby areas as well
aman baag is in real getaway with peace calm and all comforts and facilities
here nobody calls you by the english form of address
sahiba is the style of aman bagh
he has moulded his life style in new color
ajabgadh resident raambabu used to work in jaipur before this and now in this unique aman bagh with royal style
suddenly felt that these many people did nt get work even in heritage hotel
fifty percent of staff is of this area
in my ears words of my guide ram babu meena echo saahiba befor ethis we could not even think that we can stay like thisin forest
not only for those going there but also for those staying there
the place that am going to talk about is prepared only about four and half years ago but with the preparation this place has come there it has actually brough bliss in the forest
because of some one attraction people come allured
tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes journey pull you towards itself then at some time some special place it may be ship or royal train or city like pink city or the lake palace of udaipur
this journey was neither of foreign nation nor of outside rajasthan but of very near to jaipur
small journey of mine recently was very interesting and thrilling
we had come to darjeeling from kolkata to roam around darjeeling in the shadow of coolness but the tea estates spread from siligudi to darjeeling here tied me to themselves
but due to lack in time we could not go to kalimpong this time
the most popular tourist spot of kalimpong are lava and lolegaon which are filled with forests and rapids
here not the greenery of tea estates but the commuting of forests waterfalls is there
although kalimpong is city of darjeeling city only but its appearnebce is different
thee is arrangement to go to kalimpong from darjeeling city
from this route tourists go to pasupathinath temple as well where hand made sweaters ets are found by napelese artisans
boating in mirik lake here and short break in garden
the journey for darjeeling to dhooma dn from dhoom to darjeeling is special attraction for tourists
tou trains enhance the journey in the tour of darjeeling
plan was made to shop and strolling on mallroad
but as soon as reached the monastery do nt know from where did mass of black cloud presented itself and begin to shower
the mood of the weather was clean uptill now
from here wit the help of binoculars complete mountain of darjeeling and city can be seen
by rising up with the help of car we saw batusiya loop in darjeeling
both these places are placed very low among the mountains of darjeeling
we found in rock gardens that if waterfalls are magnificent in the empire of stones rocks here then the magical world of waterfalls in ganga maya is ornate with stones
the magic of waterfalls between rocks is worth seeing
on moving little more ahead downwards gangamaya sorrounded by mountains was found
the way to reach till here is even more beautiful than this
this garden is beautiful spot magnificent with rocks waterfalls and wild flowers
but fortune was very good that on reaching rock garden we roamed around while enjoying bright sunshine
it was no doubt thrilling experience in itself but worry bigger than this that if it continued to rain like this only then how will we roam around
it was planned to visit darjeeling the next day
outside karsiyang city is museum but that day we could not go there because sauntering in the unfettered environment filled with tea plantations seemed more important
in tea gardens around women carrying baskets on their backs walking with extreme brisk speed were engrossed in plucking tea leaves
it is stair like dome from the height of which surveying the entire town from height beautiful scene is presented
at the moment it is equipped with park and restaurant
it is said that in the times of the british lovers used to kill themsleves by jumping off from here
it is also called suicide point
it is point situated on the other side of the city
the next place was eagle craig
the way despite being desolate the greed to to reach till dear park sorrounded by forests and the joy of walking the path between the trees of dhoopi was providing us with energy
although the city is very beautiful and clean
karsiyang despite being brimful with beauty has not been able to be develop famous in the form of tourists spot now
ascent was above which means to reach deer park car was left much below
very small garden surrounded by huge forests on all sides
first of all deer park
therefore set out on the tour of karsiyang taking car
we made program to roam around the whole day after staying there at one place
this was karsiyang
from distance only hill looked dense with homes houses etc
at times small towns would be visible
if there was something that was not going by then they were forests and tea estates
time was also passing
serpentine and orbital path was flying by
if the gaze went towards the road the path then creation looked marvellous
as beautiful was the forest so beautiful were far spread tea plantations
both were pulling towards them
for once flurried should see these natural forests or the tea plants sowed by humans
the empire of greenery was on all four sides
here at some time forests then at other tea estates are seen
on one side green mountain filled with forests then deep gorge on the other side
passing through the road between tea estates allure hearts in first glimpse
move towards darjeeling from siligudi then in the beginning itself tea estates spreading smile welcome those moving towards it
famous for best tea production
fulll of tea plantations complete with the forests of dhoopi
karsiyang is very small city of darjeeling
right on confirming the journey of darjeeling the decision was taken to first of all take glimpse of karsiyang
it is the same greyish dawn in the rainy season
it is the same moisture caressing on the whole body
the journey is on it is different region but the same mountains same flora same rustling winds
it was told in darjeeling itself that sikkim only sikkim taxis can go that is why no checking takes place

tourism is the biggest base of the economy of rajasthan
is normal to be able to see the lines of worry in the field of tourism due to this dip that has come in the field of tourism in rajasthan
last year through this train rtdc gained crores
this train is reaping benefits regularly
amongst all this contending point for rtdc has been that there has been no dip in attraction of tourists towards palace on wheels
in the year in this fair in tourists village built by rtdc where foreign tourists had stayed this year this number is after reduction
like this only in recent years deficit in interest in tourists has been seen towards pushkar fair
even despite less fares this train could not attract tourists
attraction of tourists could not be built towards this train
the main in them is royal rajasthan of wheels
with hotels other units are also incurring it losses
the condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even fourty percent rooms of its hotels could not been filled
in year loss of rtdc remained lakh whose estimate is to become lakh
in which hotel motel eight cafeteria three yatrikas one traffic unit and two train palace in wheels and royal rajsthan on wheels are there but the condition of this corporation has also remained weak since many years
total units are there of this corporation
this corporation makes facilties of lodging food travel boating etc available
to boost tourism in rajasthan and with the purpose to develop the fundamental structure of tourism rajasthan government had constituted rtdc in year
one example of rajasthan government towards tourism is rajasthan tourism deveopment corporation limited lrb rtdc rrb
rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry years ago but it got restricted to papers only
in recent years inciedents of rape and eve teasing have in rajasthan with female tourists have also blotched the image of this state on international level
tourists coming to rajasthan also get lesser conveniences
in the field of tourism all governments talk about working on village tourism medical tourism adventure tourism very exaggeratedly but has not done anything new in this direction
desert forts ponds forests everything is the same old to serve the tourists
from the view of tourism nothing new has been happening
after year this is the first time that deficit has come in the number of tourists in rajasthan

after this the attacks other cd cells and this process is repeated again and again
destroys most of the cd cells and thus the immune system of infected person gets destroyed
do get tested
test is easy safe and available at public health centres
the following consequences show up if person is caught up with aids
person starts falling ill again and again and continuously goes on weakening
person becomes infected easily
with immune capacity lessened these contractions catch these people very easily
do not oppose the people living with aids
join the great travel of the nation against the hiv and aids
community service centre is for the people infected or unaffected with aids
here the infected persons are taken full care of and assisted so that the member of the affected family can live dignified and complete life
generally pap starts developing in girls after the age of years
today one small hole is sufficient to remove several diseases of the abdomen and the chest and this method is known as laparoscopic surgery or key hole or button hole surgery
to extract gall bladder if stone has emerged in the gall bladder
to extract the appendix in case of swelling in the appendix
to ward off the disease of peptic ulcer
to repair hiatus hernia
for the treatment of inguinal hernia
apart from this some diseases of the internal parts of chest may also be cured by this method
for example cancer lrb abdominal rrb the diseases of the liver diseases related to the intestine etc
in comparison with the traditional surgical operation this method has many advantages
in the button hole surgery the patient faces much less pain after operation
there is no need to stay at hospital for more days due to no stitches being applied
in the button hole surgery the possibility of hurting the internal components of abdomen is much less
because the internal scene is seen expanded on the screen of the television and is seen clearer directly
because of only four holes being made the possibility of these wounds getting ripened or infected becomes very less
the patient stays on bed for about week after simple surgical operation
in such situation they might have to face complexities like pneumonia clotting in the blood vessels
these possibilities are negligible in laparoscopy method
laparoscopic method takes double time in comparison with the simple treatment
patients are administered more anesthetic medicine which has its own harms
key hole surgery is revolutionary invention in the field of surgery and more and more patients are being benefited with it
the virus that can decrease the immune strength of the humans to fight diseases is called hiv
the situation in which the power to fight against diseases totally languishes or ends is called aids
the treatment of is not available as yet but it can be avoided completely
the first patient of aids in india was found in
from till the number of people living with has become forty five lacs
aids spreads from these
aids spreads through unprotected sex relations
aids spreads by administering infected blood
aids spreads through the use of unboiled or used needle
aids spreads from the infected mother to her issues
aids does not spread through these
aids does not spread through touching mutual interaction
aids does not spread through living or staying together
aids does not spread through eating together wearing eachother clothes or using same bathroom
virus gradually destroys the immune system of the body
fever does not go down diarrhoea does not stop weight decreases
the blisters of the mouth does not cure and medicines do not affect
tuberculosis pneumonia etc encircle
hundreds of such small creatures live in our body that we can see only through microscope
because of aids several such symptoms start showing up which give the inkling of aids
details of some important symptoms are given below
frequent fever for month
frequent loose motion for month
frequent cough for month
sudden decrease in body weight by percent
wounds or blisters in mouth
emergence of frequent freckles or blisters on the body
tuberculosis in which medicine does not affect
increment of lymph nodes in size at more than one place
cyst or swelling on breasts or any other place of the body
prevention of aids and propagation
there are many such diseases which have no treatment
adopt nutritious food and healthy lifestyle
avoid smoking drinking intoxicating drugs
bodybrain both will be happy
pay attention to bodily cleanliness
maintain only safe sex relations
separating and not treating persons living with in hospital is an offence
it is necessary to maintain the secrecy of the persons living with
it is necessary to give suggestions to the person living with and their family members
why discrimination when all the patients are equal to the doctor
aids is not contagious disease
infected persons live normal life for to years also
discrimination with the infected person is unjust and the indicator of our unawareness
treatment with them at office home among friends should be the same as earlier
the prevalence rate of blindness in india is percent to bring this prevalence rate to percent the national programme for control of blindness was started by the government of india
the main reason of blindness is cataract which is about percent of all blindness
under the nation programme for control of blindness the blind people specially cataract affected people are being benefited by surgical operation
special attention is being paid on the quality of the operation of cataract for which all district hospitals base hospitals are being converted into microscopic centres
the program of eye test of the to years old school students is being run as campaign in the beginning of the educational session to reduce the prevalence rate of blindness and the poor students suffering from vision problem are being distributed glasses free of cost
active help is being taken from all the governmental nongovernmental voluntary organizations in the eye test programme
the staffs related to eye department are being trained at different levels by the government of india to reduce the prevalence rate of blindness
among the chief reasons of blindness cataract is percent vision problems percent black cataract percent corneal pathology percent others percent
generally pure lens or its capsule becomes dim or milky with which the light can not reach inside the eyes and the patient can see dim or less
after identifying the patient suffering from cataract doctors and eye helpers perform screening in their hospitals
after that the patient of cataract are operated by eyesurgeon in well maintained hospitals
spectacles are tested after weeks
camping is done through government nongovernment and voluntary organizations after comprehensive propagation by district blindness control committees
the treatment of cataract is possible through surgery only
complete lens capsule is taken out in the method of intra capsular cataract extraction after the operation spectacles are used posttest
during operation lens is implanted at front of the iris the frontal part of the eye
in the extra capsular cataract method the part of the frontal capsule and the whole of the lens matter is extracted and the posterior part of the capsule is left intact
lens is fitted in the capsular bag
in the lrb small incision cataract surgery rrb method mm tunnel is formed while the rest of the method follows like that of the ecceiol
no stitches are applied in the lrb small incision cataract surgery rrb method
in black cataract the eye nerves dilapidates gradually it happens due to extra water pressure in the eye or because of not enough blood reaching in the eye nerves
the blindness caused by the black cataract can be prevented if it is identified soon and its regular treatment and tests continue
when the extra pressure is more in the eyes
if somebody suffers from black cataract in the family
in most of the patients the part of the water channel from the eyes are open yet for some reasons the water gets lessened
internal pressure keeps on increasing and the eye nerves dilapidates gradually the patient can not see things around eyesight might also be lost if treatment is not done in time
main symptoms on appearance of which patient should consult doctor
seeing rainbow like colorful ovals in light
we will check the eye nerves with special lens or equipment to find how much of damage has occurred
field test in which the capacity to see things on the sides while looking straight is tested
the part lrb angle rrb from where the water passes out can be seen through special lens
with the lack of vitamina the cornea becomes weak and wound appears through which at last causes blindness
the lack of vitamina is even more imminent in states of measles and malnutrition
nyctalopia may occur due to lack of vitamina
absorption of vitamina during lack of vitamina in food continuous diarrhoea and malnutrition
demand of vitamina during and after measles
it is visible in dim light
white surface dries up
bitot spots white spots shows up on white surface
use gram leaves fenugreek or methi leaves spinach cabbage coriander papaya mango in diet to prevent nyctalopia
encouraging mother for milk
applying vaccine at the time of measles
giving doses of vitamina lrb mn rrb during measles and at an interval of months till years lrb mn rrb
it is necessary that children are given nutritious food so that they are saved from the malnutrition caused corneal blindness
for conjunctival cataract caused by rubella vaccination is required on time
about to percent of children become blind with one eye due to injuries in the eyes
it is required that people are educated about the safety of eyes so that blindness caused by crackers industrial accidents and road traffic accidents could be escaped
to save eyes from diseases it is necessary to pay attention towards environmental sanitation and treatment is needed on time
gradual and painless lessening of vision in one or both of the eyes in month or year
pupil getting gray or white
when the rays of light do not fall on the retina or falls at the front or back of the retina
when the rays of light gets collected before the retina
fungus is also kind of being that lives in our body and harms our body
fungus creates its abode in damped places like under the nail of our toe
it is called onikomysis
the patient can see nearby things clearly but there occurs problem seeing things at distance
the patient brings things near to the eyes to see things clearly
student tries to sit very near to the blackboard in the classroom
when the rays of light collects at the back of the eye this is seen mostly in the young children
headache heaviness in the eyes problem in reading
due to weakness in the muscles of the eyes lens can not change its shape the rays of light falls behind the retina while reading or doing things at close distance this is found at an age of years or above
shadowiness in readingwriting at distance or doing things nearby
if ray of light can not concentrate at the front or back of the eye it causes shadowiness
shadowiness in seeing things nearby or at distance headache reddening of eyes
cylindrical glasses have to be worn always
cancer is lifestyle generated disease
cancer erupts by our wrong practices thoughts behavior and diet
smoking excessive cigarette causes more of windpipe cancer
we progress towards development and getting rid of diseases
due to changes in our lifestyle the number of cancer and heart patients are increasing
this disease is number one in japan in developed countries this disease in at number and in developing countries this disease is at number
one out of every eight persons can at any time become victim of cancer
this disease found in different types at different locations in our country due to difference in the lifestyle customs and religion
all the data in the country has been calculated ovarian cancer and breast cancer is found in percent of the women in cities
it is between and percent among the rural women
lungs and breathing pipe cancer is found more due to smoking and pollution and the possibility of cancer of the mouth and stomach is more with gutkha pan parag tobacco and tobacco powder
what is cancer
cancer is name of disease
in cancer cells multiply by itself and ignores the rules of the body
cells also reach other parts of the body
cell takes the form of cyst or wound and destroys all the systems coming in contact with it
cancer is group of more than diseases
although each of the disease is different from the other but basically all the types of cancers occurs as result of anomaly in some cells
generally easy tumors can be weeded out through surgery and there is no possibility of its coming up again
difficult tumors are cancer
difficult tumors can destroy nearby tissues and parts
cancer cells can spread into other areas through which new tumors can get born
as cancer can spread it is necessary that the doctor should immediately find whether the tumor is formed and that it is cancer
the treatment of cancer can start as soon as it is found
several symptoms shows up due to cancer that gives the impressions of cancer
details of some important symptoms are given below
if there is an oxalate stone in the kidney what preventions could be advantageous
any wound that do not heal in enough time
cyst or swelling on breast or any other part of the body
abnormal passing of blood or pus from any part or organ of body
continuous prolonged bouts of cough or occurrence of heaviness in speech
pain in swallowing food or during toilet continuous indigestion or constipation
change in general habits of bowels
sudden change in the size color or shape of moles or warts
however such symptoms erupts not just because of cancer there can be other reasons as well for these
therefore one should not take it as cancer just on its appearance
show these to the doctor if these symptoms stay for two weeks
there is no doubt that immediate identification of most of the cancer diseases lrb percent rrb is possible
the need is to increase the knowledge about it and for every one to take care of oneself
after identifying cancer early total treatment is now possible for percent of cancer patients
not only this the cost of early identification and immediate treatment is also much lower than late treatment
besides being aware of the symptoms of cancer all the men and the women should get themselves tested regularly
some types of cancers can be identified by general tests before any symptoms appear
doctors can find out cancer diseases of mouth breast cervix skin large intestine rectum prostate gland testicle etc even before any signs appear
cancer of the cervix is common cancer of occurring among women
among all the cancers occurring in india percent is that of cervix
lymph nodes are connected to lymph arteries and form white liquid that is called lymph
the web of lymph arteries is spread throughout the body like blood arteries
lymph nodes try to keep cancer cells to itself by filtering them
on advancement of the cancer it is not able to do this and cancer spreads from one part of the body to other part by lymph
that is why surgeons usually weed out the lymph nodes nearby the cervix also
cervical cancer can spread through blood circulation
for changes in skin particularly any kind of growth in moles or warts you should get tested regularly
any kind of changes should be shown to the doctor immediately
doctor should also test the skin during general medical checkup
regular medical checkup is important for early detection of cancer of the large intestine and the rectum
doctor can find out about the disease by inserting gloved finger in the rectum
annual test of everybody after the age of years is necessary
blood can occur with the faeces due to cancer of the large intestine
comprehensive test is mandatory for confirmed diagnosis the doctor should do sigmoidoscopy lrb telescopic test of the rectum rrb of the rectum and the large intestine in period of to years for persons crossing the age of years
the most credible method of finding out the prostate cancer in its initial stage is the test of gloved finger by the doctor
an annual checkup of everybody above the age of years must be done
with annual test any irregular or abnormal areas can be found out and it can be known whether there is tumor or not
testicular gland cancer could be found out by most of the men themselves
men can find out any changes in the testicular gland by testing themselves every month
the best time to test it is during the time of bathing with hot water or after when the testicle is flaccid as in this situation any changes can be easily figured out
while testing the testicular gland by oneself if one finds swelling cyst or any other kind of defect particularly an abnormal pain on touching the testicular gland pain or heaviness then the doctor should consulted
testicular gland test should also be part of the regular annual medical test of the humans by the doctors
regular test of mouth is required for the signs of mouth cancer
change of tissues of mouth can be the initial stage of cancer
change of tissues of mouth can be easily seen and experienced
dentist should test the mouth of every patient in every form
changes occurring in gum lips and cheek should be paid attention
scab cracks swelling bleeding or cyst or tumor in any part of the mouth should be paid special attention

even if the menstruation period has stopped women should appoint day lrb whenever rrb each month for test
this test is specially important for women above the age of years
the danger of breast cancer increases in age above years
if woman feels cyst or any kind of change in the breasts she should consult doctor
about percent of the cysts of the breasts are not cancer but only doctor can correctly find it out
any abnormal situations like cyst in the breasts or breasts becoming very large must be tested during the medical test of women
after the age of years every women must get mammogram done in to years
if the age of women goes up to years then mammogram should be done every year
the women whose mothers sister blood aunts etc have cancer should start getting mammography done since years
cancer is tested through pathology
it is seen in microscope
cancer can be found out through other tests like xray scan ultrasound also
list of training test centres where cancer can be tested
surgery depends on the stage of the cancer
if cancer is in limited area and in initial stage then along with the affected area some normal areas are also extracted
it is attempted that no particle of cancer is left out
if cancer has also entered other areas then surgery is done to lessen the size of the cancer
cancer cells are burnt through laser
before laser calculation of area of cancer spread capacity of the patient time of laser based on the cancer stage area strength is done
then mark applied on the skin
entry for any other person is prohibited in that room during the laser
there is no pain in radioactive rays
sometimes the skin may become red or patient may feel like vomiting
some cancers like blood cancer and the cancer of the cysts can be fully treated with medicine
these medicines destroy the cancer cells
general cells may also be affected with these medicines
nails may fall
there might occur decrement in blood which may cause tiredness
if the patient takes medicine in regular cycle and eats healthy food he can recover fully
during the treatment blood should be tested regularly one should have clean water and clean food
one should not sit with sick person because the immune strength gets very lessened with medicines
incurable cancer patients are kept in palliative care so that their physical mental pain could be lessened
list of hospitals where the treatment of cancer is available
awareness and prevention from cancer
prevention from tobacco and tobacco related products and quitting control
eating fresh fruits and green vegetables clean normal vegetarian food
exercise fast for at least half an hour everyday
lessening the use of excessive chilly fried roasted meat ghee wine
not making any physical relationship before the age of years

information related to cancer its symptoms harms of tobacco selfbreast test and prevention has been given in junior high schools
all the hospitals superintendant base hospital district hospital women hospital medical college and private hospitals in the state have been asked to maintain cancer register
they will register cancer patients coming to their outdoor department and post this report to the directorate every month
we will find out what is the number of cancer patients in the state and in which area which cancer has been found more
chicken pox lrb varicella rrb
chicken pox is viral that erupts out of contact with varicella zoster lrb vzv rrb
fever and eruption of special kind of papules is the sign of chicken pox
virus spreads from one person to another person through air born drops
it erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of person infected with chicken pox
it can also spread through direct contact with chicken pox or herpes because there is contagious liquid in raw wounds
in some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to new born baby
chicken pox is the most contagious few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds till it dries up which often happens week after the spots have started
fever shivering nausea and vomiting are the most clear and famous symptoms eruption of blisters and extreme itching freckles
in most of the children blisters erupt that later become scabs
chicken pox can attack both young and adult men and women
most of the people become victim of chicken pox one time or the other in their childhood or adolescence
but if adults who had never been victim of chicken pox come into contact with such case they are in danger of contraction and they may suffer from chicken pox in adulthood
chicken pox is more serious in adolescents and adults in comparison with children
fever stays for longer time
keeping infected persons away from school or work helps in decreasing the spread of the virus but vaccination is an effective solution to escape the pain of chicken pox
fever is estimated with symptoms like high fever acute body pain headache joint pain eye pain and finding of papules on body
besides the above general symptoms complaints of bleeding from teeth mouth or nose also occur in serious patients of chicken pox
tourniquet test comes positive in chicken pox patients and platelet count is found less than lac on blood test
dengue fever occurs after sting of aedes aegypti
aedes aegypti is also known by the name of tiger mosquito and it stings during the day time

diabetes is such kind of disease as result of which sugar becomes very high in blood
diabetes is serious disease which if not controlled can be killing
on being under attack of diabetes our body forms insulin which helps in lessening sugar
sugar increases in the blood with lack of insulin
if you have the following symptoms then you may have diabetes
frequent feeling of urination
feeling more thirsty and dim vision
physical inability in sexual activities
numbness in feet or paralysing feeling in them
problems occurring from diabetes
the following problems and complexities can emerge from diabetes
excess of sugar in blood long term complexities
damage to tendons or neuropathy
damage to kidney or nephropathy
damage to eyes or retinopathy
disease and contraction of heart and blood vessels
long term complexities of diabetes
damage to tendons diabetes damages the tendons of feet and hands
shivering numbness inflammation or pain may occur due to damage to the tendons which often starts from the tip of the fingers of your feet or hands and increases gradually upwards
if treatment is not done then you can lose the power of feeling in the affected organs
damage to kidney delicate filtering system present in the kidney may be damaged with diabetes by which kidneys may stop working and dialysis or kidney transplantation may be required
diabetes may damage the retina of your eyes which may cause blindness
disease of heart and blood vessels the main complexity of diabetes is the damage of heart and blood vessels by which heart attack paralysis and defect in blood circulation may occur
studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes
excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this
your mouth gums lungs skin feet kidney bladder and the areas of reproductive organs all of them can be easily affected with contagion
dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle
the chances of bringing the situation back to the predamage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests
every disease occurs due to type of virus
virus is so small that they can not be seen through common microscope
if polluted mosquito bites person then the virus enters into the body of that person
after about to days the symptoms of disease start appearing in that person
usually the following symptoms are found in the patients of diabetes
high fever
acute pain
stiffness in neck
stiffness in body
strokes in body
nausea and vomiting
fainting or total nervousness
as soon as the above mentioned symptoms appear the patient should immediately be admitted for treatment at the nearby primary health center subdivisional government hospital or district hospital
malaria spreads through mosquitoes therefore it is necessary that the number of mosquitoes be decreased in community

wear pants pyjama dhoti socks full sleeved kurta or shirt in the evening
use mosquito nets while sleeping wherever possible
do not let rain water collect near the ditches nearby house
cooperate with the health staffs in sprinkling insecticides and fogging
use fine nets to stop mosquitoes enter the pigsties
get the vaccine of encephalitis administered in time
hepatitisa is one of the most widespread disease spreading in the whole world
this occurs due to hepatitisa virus and it is common at places with bad level of cleanliness
virus attacks lever and causes diseases of different intensity to emerge in the patients
hepatitisa viral spreads in the faeces and at first it spreads through the anal passage
the virus comparatively takes long time to show symptoms and is contagious
therefore the infected person can spread the disease to other people even before it develops
nausea jaundice purge light colored faeces stomach ache weakness tiredness fever shivering not feeling hungry neck pain etc
symptoms are dependent on the frequency of emergence
hepatitisa and are two different kinds of viral hepatitis that occur due to different kinds of viruses
every type of hepatitis is different
hepatitisa can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitisb
similarly hepatitisb can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitisa
the vaccine is available now and is the most practical solution against hepatitisa
primary vaccination keeps person safe for year and the booster dose administered after six months gives safety for about years
combined vaccine is available from glaxosmithkline which provides safety from both hepatitisa and hepatitisb through single safety order administered at months
the combined vaccine of hepatitisa and hepatitisb is available in two forms
paediatric dose one dose is of ml for children and adolescents
adult dose the dose is of ml for adults of the age of years and above
hepatitisb is worldwide disease which occurs due to hepatitisb virus lrb hbv rrb
hbv affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs
the cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted
the results of infection are different and unexpected
the results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system
hepatitisb is extremely contagious and it is thought to be times more contagious than the hiv
in comparison with aids hepatitisb victimises more people to death in the whole year
blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitisb disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm vaginal fluids and saliva are included
hbv spreads in three ways from mother to child at birth time and from person to person
the most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitisb and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination
after vaccination people who have developed protective antibacterial reactions can get total safety from intense and old contraction along with diseases
with extensive use of hepatitisb vaccination remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitisb infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitisb
yellow fever is also called yellow jack black vomit negro vomit or american plague
the combined vaccine is made for children and adults
what precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again
the huge problem of increasing population has stayed in india after independence
the family welfare program was run at the national level in the year of
on the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in cairo lrb egypt rrb in the year of that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare
all the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of single element within family planning services
therefore the concept of reproductive and child health programme was born
reproductive and child health programme is being run since the year of in india
this program has been running in uttarakhand since the constitution of the state
reproduction rate has always been low in uttarakhand in comparison with the original state uttar pradesh
raw birth rate of this state in the period of was which decreased to become in the period of and during the years of this rate lowered more and stayed at only
among the districts this rate is the least in paudi while the most in haridwar
gross reproduction rate lrb the number of infants given birth by woman in her life time rrb which was estimated to be more than for the period of has been continuously decreasing and in the year of this number was
inter district differences has also occurred less during this period
raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas
it is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state
generally birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas
about one fourth of the women give birth to the next child within months
little less than half of the mothers lrb percent rrb give birth to more than kids
about percent of the births come in the category of serious danger
it is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to uttarakhand in particular
according to the estimates of sample registration system lrb rrb the death rate was estimated on the population of every during the year of which is lower than the national average of
the infant mortality rate of the state was every live births in the year of which is very less than the national rate lrb rrb
two third deaths out of the total infant mortality number occurs during the period of infancy itself
infant mortality rate in uttarakhand is per live births
data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available
considering odd physical situations of the state it can be said that the maternal mortality rate in the state would be very high
noncommunicable disease is becoming big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization
the goal of reproductive and child health welfare programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate
this program is being run to give special importance to the participation of men with relation to reproductive and child health welfare programme to provide complete knowledge of protected and effective contraceptive methods to men and women to make medical facilities available to the pregnant women during pregnancy and to help parents get healthy new born babies

leprosy is bacteria born contagious disease
the name of this bacteria is microbacterium leprae
microbacterium leprae affects mainly the nervous system and the skin
incubation period of leprosy is three years on an average and this disease grows very slowly
leprosy can affect persons of any age and sex equally
the medicine cures the patient completely by eradicating the leprosy bacteria and prevents the disease from spreading in the society
all the leprosy patients are not contagious
most of the patients are noncontagious who can not spread the disease only to percent patients are contagious
leprosy is comparatively much less contagious than other diseases such as measles etc
about percent of the people have the resistance capability to fight leprosy thereby this disease can not happen to them
the main symptoms and identification of leprosy are as follows
light yellow or discolored reddish spot or stain on skin of the body that has numbness the spot has no feeling of pain inflammation itching or piercing or cold and hot

fingers start becoming malformed wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly
most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage
wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients
complete treatment is possible even in the stage of wound and ulcer but the disability and deformity that occurred due to lateness in treatment can not be brought back to the previous state through medicines
yes the hands and feet of the disabled person can be formed in such way through simple operations so that the patient can work again and run his livelihood
malaria spreads through the bite of female anopheles mosquito

use mosquito nets while sleeping or apply mustard oil on open parts of the body
install fine nets on windows of house
do not let water collect near yourself
if this is not possible then pour some petrolubricants oil on the collected water
the disease of measles can take very serious form in developing countries because the death rate due to this is more than percent
therefore it is recommended to administer its vaccination to the children at the earliest possible
besides the antibody level of mothers and doses of vaccination considering the incidents of the disease it is recommended by the world health organisation to administer the vaccine of measles to the children at the age of nine months
among the indications and symptoms of measles are included fever common symptoms of cold conjunctivitis cough stains inside mouths and the red papules erupting on the skin
besides this loose motion stomach ache and lack of hunger like symptoms may also be show up during the contraction
in comparison with children the symptoms of measles shows up more seriously in adolescents its incubation period is about days and almost no symptoms of this disease shows up from outside during this period
during the period of to days at first local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well
after this having spread through the whole of the blood circulation the virus takes the form of primary disease
the period between the entrance of the bacteria and the start of the disease
mumps or contagious perotitis is kind of serious contagious disease in which swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining
saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth
besides this mouth also starts drying up due to mumps
rubella or german measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children adolescents and youths
rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for while
the most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules the most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as result of which birth defects occur in children
about to percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly
when rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened
live attenuated vaccines of measles mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called mmr
mmr vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine
the use of mmr vaccines has been extremely effective
immunisation power achieved with mmr stays for more time and almost throughout the life
start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy
however the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of primary vaccination programme
the world health organisation believes that single dose is not enough to eradicate measles
therefore now it is recommended by both and the unicef that besides giving its first dose at months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles
disorder of the brain that affects the capacity to think understand work or feel
such system of brain is called mental disorder
it is estimated that percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about percent are victims of common mental disease
it is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals percent are mentally ill
mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness epilepsy sleeplessness hypersomnia change in copulation and copulation process mood change schizophrenia dementia delirium change in personality
yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease
yellow fever is main disease is african and latin american countries
it is called yellow fever because in many of its patients symptoms of jaundice shows up
not paying attention to any work
being sad without any reason
getting angry very soon very often
change in mood very soon being sorry from happiness and getting happy again
getting disturbed soon by the small talk of children
thinking oneself as always correct and others wrong
emergence of desire to take tobacco alcohol cannabis marijuana
problem in desire or the process of copulation
before declaring mental disorder for any patient his total mental agony is seen lrb in which present problems old and new problems family or problems near him can be seen rrb and then his physical and mental test is done
if needed lab tests of ecg rft lft eeg and ct scan diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done
treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods
listening to the patient and his family and providing information about his mental health
encouraging the patient to change emotionally
making people aware by propagating for mental health through press radio health fairs posters banners etc in every district
making social environment better encouraging participation and social relations among people in the society

saving mental patient from falling ill again
the following is be executed in the state under the mental health program
state mental health authority has been constituted in the state since april
bed state mental hospital is being constructed at dehradun under the mental health authority program
two districts of uttarakhand have been chosen under the district mental health programme
dehradun in the garhwal division and nainital in the kumaun division
for which proposal of lac has been sent to the government of india
this program will be implemented in both the districts of dehradun and nainital
the national maternity benefit scheme has been transferred from social welfare department to health welfare department since by the government of india
the process of transfer is now complete
the national maternity benefit scheme is being implemented by the health department in the state of uttarakhand
under the national maternity benefit scheme above year old women living below the poverty line are given an assistance of rs on first live delivery for proper nutrition
the details of the capital received from the government of india and the intended beneficiaries in and under the national maternity benefit scheme are as follows
the following programs are being run in the state of uttarakhand under the maternity and infant welfare services
little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get predelivery tests done in uttarakhand while this is percent at the national level
the percentage of the women getting the predelivery test done thrice is only
there is huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of predelivery services in the urban and the rural areas
more than three fourth of the women lrb percent rrb in the urban areas gets the predelivery test done at least once while little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so
little more than one third lrb percent rrb of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills
in cases of tetanus toxide injection percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of however such women in the rural areas are percent and in the urban areas percent
generally there is much less vogue of predelivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards the following works are done mainly under this service
indicating pregnant women
distribution of pills to prevent anemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases
there are only percent of institutional delivery in uttarakhand
this is percent in cities while in rural areas more than percent of labor occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives
even in urban areas more than half lrb percent rrb of childbirths takes place at home
in uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about percent with trained maids assistant health workers and midwives
out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth lrb percent rrb is benefitted with postlabour tests within two months
safe childbirth and referencing of complex cases is mainly done under the postchildbirth services
care for mother and the newborn baby referencing of complex cases vaccination of babies distribution of vitamina solution to protect children from blindness proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion
comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of and has been shown in the following table
the disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans
this contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person
however this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth
polio disease particularly attacks young children
to percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than years of age
polio is an extremely contagious disease
till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities
oral poliovirus vaccine lrb opv rrb was first used in the contemporary soviet union
as result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries
the most relevant proof of the great success of opv is the polio eradication programme being run throughout the world
the pulse polio programme run in india for polio eradication has also been very much successful
combined dtp vaccines have been used the world over since itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help
by giving doses of dtp vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria tetanus and pertussis
diphtheria is such contagion that affects throat mouth and nose
diphtheria is contagious disease easily contractible but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less
sex related diseases are contagious diseases this disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one sex partner during sexual intercourse
this is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases their contraction is easy
contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy
sexually transmitted diseases are serious and painful
the most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are gonorrhoea herpes chlamydia
many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially these symptoms end without any treatment
some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all
person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he can infect his sexual partner or unborn children
uncommon oozing or stench pain below abdomen lrb between naval and the reproductive organs rrb
inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina symptoms both is men and women
wounds near reproductive organs swelling or papules and crust in mouth pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting
fever cold body ache like in flu swelling near reproductive organs
if proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them
dead birth due to inborn syphilis
the birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases
blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction
swelling in conjuctiva of the eye
contracted sexual behavior is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease
the following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease
do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules reddening wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs
keep away from uncommon sexual relations
wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse
hiv contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases
it is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities
remember encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behavior is not followed
most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment
tuberculosis is contagious disease
tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis
the tuberculosis disease spreads through air from tuberculosis patient to healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex
tuberculosis patient can infect persons in year
about adults die everyday of tuberculosis in india which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases
tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs bones joints or the sides of lymph nodes
this disease is found commonly in the lungs
in comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease
because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much
the quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much people are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done
in comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis
according to fresh research lac children in india drop out of school due to this disease every year
the maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in india
although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about per lac
in comparison to any other disease women die the most of tuberculosis in india
the number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined
this has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis
in comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in hiv positive humans increases times
tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the dots strategy
coughs of weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis lrb of the lungs rrb
the easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm
the bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing
the bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis
diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm xray is also used if necessary
list of training test centres where cancer can be tested
tuberculosis can be completely cured
if the patient does the treatment regularly
there is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering little the patient quits treatment
treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the dots strategy
in dots strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers
which is called dots lrb directly observed treatment with short course chemotherapy rrb
as is revealed from the name directly observed treatment with short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of antituberculosis drugs in presence of health worker
there are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis
intensive phase which goes on for months
continuation phase is of months which depends on the category of the treatment patient is taking
under this program these medicines are taken thrice week on alternate days for months lrb intensive phase rrb
after this phlegm is tested which if found negative the patient is issued antituberculosis drugs once in week in the calendared multiblistered combo pack
remember the first dose of the weekly pack has to be taken before the health worker
during the continuation phase after two months phlegm should be tested and also after the treatment is complete
you will watch the patient during the period of continuation phase
the best way to check the disease is that if all the phlegm patients are made negative then the patient can not infect and whoever human is having coughs of more than three weeks then he should be encouraged to take dots after the three phlegm test
yellow fever is mosquito communicated disease
yellow fever is supposed to be the cause of several epidemics
yellow fever occurs due to an arbovirus of the family of flaviviridae
arbovirus is gram positive singleformula rna virus
like malaria this virus also enters into humans through mosquito saliva
the mosquitoes that spread yellow fever aedes simpsaloni aedes africanus and aedes aegypti
children can be saved from tuberculosis by administering bcg vaccine
vaccine must be administered after birth as early as possible
refer the patient for treatment to the near primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center
send the persons having cough with phlegm or without phlegm or phlegm with blood for three weeks or more to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for tests
keep enquiring about the tuberculosis patients whether they went to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for advice or not
you must get all the babies of the area vaccinated for bcg with the help of the health workers lrb women rrb
educate people all about the prevention of tuberculosis and controlling it
two medicine stores dehradun and udham singh nagar have been built in the state to distribute medicines
so that the medicines could be made available to faroff districts in time
supply of medicines is done by the government of india
to run revised national tuberculosis control programme properly fourwheeler vehicle has been made available by the government of india in districts lrb tehri paudi uttarkashi chamoli nainital pithauragarh almora and dehradun rrb
each treatment centres has been provided with twowheeler by the government of india
each microscopic centre has been provided with one binocular microscope
districts lrb haridwar udham singh nagar rudraprayag bageshwar and champawat rrb have been provided with four wheeler vehicle by the state government
tetanus is type of infection which occurs due to such bacteria that are found in dust dirt and rusted metals
the bacteria of tetanus enters inside through normal cuts occurring to the body
muscles convulse because of the bacteria
if the bacteria attack the muscles of the jaws then jaws convulse and the mouth neither opens nor it closes
generally it is very fast but some of its slow cases shows up when person is already infected with flavivirus
after the infection the virus at first increases its number by reproducing locally after that it spreads throughout the body through lymph carrying arteries
the muscle of the breathing pipe also convulse due to tetanus
this is kind of bacteria that closes the lungs with phlegm lrb kind of sticky wet material rrb due to which such an acute sound comes out on coughing as if dog is barking
the start of yellow fever starts suddenly to days after the infection
because of bacteria such organisms may also emerge that causes pneumonia and bronchitis lrb infection of the lungs rrb
typhoid fever is such disease that starts as an infection in the gastrointestinal passage and takes the form of fullfledged disease
the cause of typhoid is type of insect that is called salmonella typhi
each patient has different symptoms of it but some symptoms are included in common symptoms periodic fever headache tiredness and weakness change in behavior and stomach problems in the initial stage of the disease and constipation followed by loose motion
when any food item or beverage with salmonella typhi is taken then generally most of organic constituents become inactive by the presence of the acid present in the abdomen
if these insects reach the abdomen in great numbers then some of these insects reach the small intestine
vaccine is the most effective and reliable solution for safety for typhoid fever
typhoid vaccination is recommended by different international and national health officers for persons traveling the regional areas
this vaccination is also recommended for school children and youth and adults as well in the areas where typhoid fever is present as major public health problem in the persons of that age group
salmonella typhi with antibiotic resistance is found in typhoid fever
this is how you should take care of your teeth
high fever cold bleeding from skin high heart pulse headache waist pain and diabetes occur in serious cases of yellow fever
the death rate goes up to on the spread of yellow fever as an epidemic
yellow fever disease spreads in different ways in the rural and jungle areas and in the urban areas
the effect is very high in the cities due to more density of population and more carrier mosquito population
there is no real treatment for yellow fever
most of the virus generated diseases do not have cure only corollary treatment and treatment on the basis of symptoms are done
the patient of fever should be given lot of rest fresh air and plenty of liquid to drink
in the hamster model of the yellow fever using ribavirin early is considered to an effective treatment
ribavirin is effective in yellow fever in the same as it proves effective in hepatitisc
historical report says that the death rate in this disease has been from to
cdc has said that the death rate is considered to be
while the who has said in fact sheet issued in that patients enter toxic stage in which half of them die and half are saved
yellow fever has an very important place in the history of afric america europe and the caribbean islands
yellow fever spread the worst in in the united states due which thousand had died in mississippi valley itself
naturopathy is medicalphilosophy
the basis of treatment of diseases and health recuperation under naturopathy is the natural strength of the body to fight disease molecules
there are several methods under naturopathy such as water therapy homeopathy sun therapy acupuncture acupressure soil therapy etc
the contribution of several medical therapies are there in the propagation of naturopathy such as the ayurveda of india and the nature cure of europe
naturopathy is creative method of treatment the goal of which is to end the root cause of disease with the use of available elements
this is not just treatment method but life style according to the internal important powers or natural elements present in the human body
in this natural treatment method natural food specially fresh fruits and raw or lightly cooked vegetables play conclusive role in the treatment of different diseases
naturopathy is total revolution in life style and science
naturopathy is special boon for the poor persons and the poor nations
abnormal state of any part of skin is called skin disease
skin is the biggest system of the body
this occurs due to direct contact with external environment
besides this the diseases of several other systems of parts lrb such as piles rrb are expressed through the skin itself
chikungunya is long extending disease of the joints
great pain occurs in the joints in chikungunya
the aggressive stage of chikungunya goes on for to days only but the pain of joints continue for months or weeks
chikununya virus is an arbovirus that is considered to be of the family of alphavirus
chikungunia enters into human through the bite of aedes mosquito
it takes to days for chikungunia to spread after entering into body
the patients of chikungunia can have acute joint pain for long time that depends on their age
chikungunia disease spreads in the cycle of humanmosquitohuman
the virus of chikungunia is found mainly in monkeys but other species including humans can also be affected from it
the most effective way of safety from the disease of chikungunia is to escape coming in contact with disease carrying mosquitoes
there is no treatment for chikungunia nor is there any vaccine available against it
chloroquine is proving effective against the symptoms of chikungunia
kidney stones is disease of the urinary system in which small stone like hard things form inside the kidney
generally these stones are flushed out from the body through the urinary passage
but if they grow enough lrb mm in size rrb then these can create blockage in the urinary tract
stone is found normally in the people of the age of to years
stone is found four times more among men than in women
stone of bladder forms more in children and old people while in adults stone form mostly in kidney and urinary tract
the most regrettable thing is that only few percent patients of stone get it treated
the patients having diabetes have good chance of catching the disease of kidney
if patient has the disease of blood pressure then he should pay attention on controlling blood pressure with regular medicine
because if blood pressure increases kidneys may also malfunction
state of pain in case of stone in kidney
in stone sudden pain occurs in the lower part of the back or abdomen which goes up to the joint of the abdomen and thighs
the pain of stone stays for some minutes or hours and relief comes intermittently
there can also be complaint of nausea along with pain and vomiting
if there is an infection in part related to urinary system then fever shivering perspiration pain along with urine etc may also be included in the symptoms
blood also may come in urine
most of the patients of stone in kidney complain of acute pain starting from towards the abdomen
this pain arises intermittently and stays for from few minutes till several hours this is called renal chronine
the chief symptom of stone disease is that in it the pain starts from the lower part of the back and goes towards thighs
stone of the kidneys are diagnosed by complete medical test xraysonography dye injection or ultrasound tests
some solutions of safety from stone
drink plenty of water so that to litre of urine forms everyday
there should be less amount of protein nitrogen and sodium in diet
do not take such materials which has more amount of oxalate such as chocolate soyabean almond spinach etc
avoid cocacola and other such beverages
heavy amount of vitaminc should not be taken
the danger of stone is less with the juice of orange etc
different kinds of stones some out of which are made of calcium and some of uric acid
the meaning of organ transplant is to transplant healthy and functional organ from body in the place of damaged or unsuccessful part of another body
transplanting an organ of patient into another organ of the same patient also comes under the category of organ transplant
organ donator can be both alive or dead
among the transplantable organs are included heart kidney liver lungs pancreas penis eyes and intestine
transplantation medicine is one of the most challenging and complex areas of modern medical discipline
unacceptance of transplanted organ by the body is among some of the biggest problems of the medical management area
where the immune system of the body rejects the transplanted organ by reacting against it and because of this transplant becomes unsuccessful and now big challenge for the transplant medicine is to keep the transplanted organ active in the same body
transplantation is very time sensitive process
bones tendons cornea heart valves veins arm and skin are included among the tissues that can be transplanted
there is lack of suitable organs for transplant in most of the countries
there is formal system to alleviate risks of unacceptance and to manage allocation in most of the countries
some countries are attached to international organizations such as eurotransplant so that the supply of organs can be assured
transplantation also brings some life ethical issues to the fore such as definition of death when and how an agreement is to be given for an organ and payment for the used organ in transplant
amoeba dysentry disease emerges from special kind of microbic bacteria called entamoeba histolytica
entamoeba is present in the large intestine of the body in two forms
these forms are called cyst and ova
humans takes it inside the body in the form of cyst through food items and beverages
this cyst sometimes takes the form of eggs on entering the large intestine
among the main symptoms of dysentery patient has diarrhoea along with an acute form of stomach ache and an acute convulsion occurs near the anus
on diagnosing such patients tenderness is found in caecum and the left iliac region and some fever also occurs
flies are extremely helpful in spreading dysentery
toilet occurs to times or more day and most of the part of the excreta is mucus and thickened blood
sometimes this amoeba enters the portal vein and creates epatitis and abscess blisters
abscess is serious type of fatal disease
when the abscess blasts then as result its pus creates several fatal diseases on entering lungs stomach large intestine peritoneum and pericardium
among the main symptoms of abscess there is an acute pain in the liver part of the patient which sometimes spreads to the right shoulder
besides this headache shivering and fever also reach their pinnacle
patient feels acute pain and burn on just touching the liver part and the skin above it becomes sensitive
to avoid abscess all the food items and beverages should be kept away from flies
the person from whose excreta the cyst comes out should not do any work of the kitchen until blood and phlegm has stopped coming through excreta
the patient of dysentery should eat barley
if the power of eyes is more then one should wear contact lens
contact lens should be of high quality
washing eyes regularly is good habit
when the mucus has stopped coming out then the patient of dysentery can be given thin tapioca pearls lrb sabudana rrb arrowroot rice curd etc
for good health of the eyes one should have vitamina rich diet
the health of eyes remain good with regular yoga as well
your eyes are priceless protect it

the most common tumors found in women are swelling of the uterus glands fibroid or leiomyoma
this knot is found in approximately to women
this fact has come forward from regular sonography
in many cases this does not produce any symptoms but in many cases this becomes reason for pain bleeding and infertility
predominantly this is seen in women of years of age
young girls also get infested with this at times
the size of the swelling decreases after menopause
but after taking hormone therapy the size may increase again
this disease is found more in women of dark complexion in comparison to women of fair complexion
the possibility of the occurrence of this increases if there are no or few children
this disease is seen less also in women who use pills for family planning
the danger of fibroid increases in menarche at young age
if mother sister etc in the family have fibroid tumor then the possibility of the occurrence of this increases
the danger also increases with the consumption of alcohol cigarette and meat
vegetarianism helps in being saved from fibroid
this is the tumor of muscles and fibrous tissues
approximately fibroids are symptom less
unusual excessive bleeding pain during menses
pain in abdomen pain of waist
infertility due to knot inside uterus
symptoms due to pressure difficulty in micturition
need of delivery with operation
anemia due to excessive bleeding post delivery
difficulties occur many times in the cure of fibroid
the uterus also increases in ovarian tumor endometriosis pregnancy adenomyosis etc
important tests
sonography through abdomen and vagina
the presence of swelling glands only is not prerequisite for its removal
if the submucos fibroid is small then it can be removed through hysteroscopic uterine endoscopy
the submucos fibroid can also be removed with laser
before the removal of intramural fibroid it is seen what is the age of the woman whether there are children or not whether the family is complete or not what does the female want
myomectomy operation can be carried out through hysteroscopy or laparoscopy or laprotomy lrb opening the abdomen rrb
only the tumor is taken out in case of young women who do not want more children
if the age is not less the tumor is quite big and there is no need for children then the whole uterus is removed together with the knot hysterectomy
by putting pipe through the thigh artery in laparoscopic myolysis the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl and gel foam particles
the supply of blood reaching the swelling glands gets stopped through this and the swelling glands reduce up to
breast cancer is dreadful name for women
thousands of deaths occur due to cancer being not recognized in initial days
in cancer maximum people break down mentally and financially
if breast cancer is recognized in the initial condition itself then its treatment is possible without any physical deformity
at the same time cent percent patients can be ridden from the disease also
thus lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and financial agony
in present times due to changes in social and living habits etc cancer is spreading very fast
till date many methods of cancer test like mammography mri ct scan etc are helpful though but somehow or the other the side effects of radiation is seen in these
in this condition the doctors have got hold of new weapon infrared thermography
in infrared thermography breast cancer due to ill effects of lethal radiation can be tested as fast as possible
greek and egyptian doctors were aware of the disease of breast cancer and temperature of the body
sir william harchell discovered infrared and thermal radiations in ad
but till it was not certain that infrared could be used in the field of medicine
breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in its very initial days
lacs of women can be benefitted from breast thermography
the use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of arteries being narrow as well etc in diabetes
if there is swelling in brain brain tumor or meningitis in brain then the pressure of intracranial veins increases
if there is rheumatoid arthritis or spondilitis then swelling occurs in eyes
the effect of blood pressure on eyes is huge
due to blood pressure the veins of the eyes may be blocked or else bleeding can occur
due to this the eye sight may go even
all the diseases of kidney and head can be diagnosed through eyes easily
anything altered on eyes has direct impact on kidney
how much diabetes damages our body even this can be diagnosed through eyes alone
by taking the medicine chloroquine the eye sight can completely go
eye sight can weaken due to viagra
if someone has diabetes then he must go to the doctor even if there is no eye problem
the eyes of children after four years must be tested
if there is any problem in his eyes then that can be corrected with this
in small kids if there is any complaint of eye squint then many times it can be corrected even without surgery
with age the eyes should certainly be tested at least once in year
if having vision syndrome then the person must get the check up done continuously
do not put any medicine in the eyes without consulting the doctor
if anyone paternal uncle maternal uncle father or mother have cataract then the check up must be done regularly
due to cataract the pressure of the eyes can increase because of which the veins can be spoiled
many times cataract comes fast in the eyes
never look towards sun with naked eyes
there is always need to protect eyes from the ultraviolet rays of the sun
the eye sight does not increase by walking on green grass
green grass only provides freshness or coolness to the feet
reduction in the power of eyes by using spectacles or increase by not using this never happens
our eyes do not get spoiled by tv computer or less light
no type of exercise can increase the eye sight
the word arthritis means the swelling of joints and more than even types of joint swellings have been put under the category of arthritis
at any age arthritis disease can take one in its captivity
arthritis disease has been seen in kids as well
this disease is common thing in people of years and above
in people of years and above this disease also happens in serious and more painful condition
as the age increases the cases of arthritis also increase
persons out of every below years of age have been seen to be patients of arthritis
if the cure and treatment of arthritis is not done on time then it causes great damage to the joints and bones of the body
although arthritis is disease affecting women world wide
in our country this disease affects women even more because of special actions like sitting down for toilet or sitting down on floor for domestic work
the knee joint is actually the joint between the thigh bone lrb femur rrb and the bone of foot lrb tibia rrb
the cartilage once destroyed may not be corrected again by any medicine
because of the reason of damage happening in cartilage the patient suffering from arthritis also faces problem in activities like walking climbing up the stairs and sitting down or taking bath while sitting down
if the correct cure of arthritis is done in time then relief to great extent from this disease is possible
fast treatment means less damage to the joints and because of this the patient has to suffer less pain
generally the advice of surgery is also given on arthritis becoming serious
in patients where arthritis has reached the preliminary stage for patients in whom alternatives like unicompartmental knee resurfacing and hip resurfacing are very beneficial
total hip knee replacement lrb tkr rrb is useful in case of arthritis affecting the entire joint
tkr does not mean that the knee of patient is removed and metal implant is fixed
in tkr new surface is put at the end of the bones
the newest alternative in knee implant is rotating platform high flexion knee due to which in all activities like walking bending during gardening sitting for driving or exercising climbing down the stairs the patient gets comfort
with high flexion knee bending up to is possible
much more satisfaction is felt by patients who have already got rotating platform high flexion knee implant and they are able to fulfil the activities of daily life in better way
by adopting good habits of proper medical care surgical alternatives and balanced life style and proper food habits one can to great extent get rid of an epidemic like arthritis
apart from medicine and surgery balanced food also plays an important role in dealing with arthritis in proper way
increase the quantity of vitamins minerals anti oxidants and other nutritive substances and by doing this you can keep your weight under control
the situation of arthritis becomes grave when weight increases
eat more and more fresh fruits and vegetables especially eat more fruits containing vitamin like apples oranges cherries peppers tomatoes beet roots sweet potato etc so that the joints can stay protected
with fibrous food like whole grain barley and brown rice help can also be obtained in keeping healthy physique especially joints
keep away from taking fried food
more and more calcium rich food must be consumed
calcium rich food keeps the bones protected
by doing regular exercises also the muscles around the joints is made strong
if there is any wart knot or wound on any part of the body and still does not dry up quickly then be cautious this can be skin cancer
cancer of the skin generally appears in the form of small knot
this knot can appear at any place like hand leg face etc
the knot can be of normal color or else of black color
in preliminary stage the knot is painless and because of this reason we commit grave mistake
because of no pain in the knot the patient does not give attention to the treatment of the knot
with the increase of knot it starts paining
many times cancer appears in the form of small wound
the wound does not pain if there is cancer
the cancer of the wound goes on increasing and at one stage pain occurs in that
many times cancer appears in non dangerous knots
therefore do not forget any knot
if there is non dangerous knot in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms
wound forming in the knot
knot increasing rapidly
pain in the knot
colour change in the knot
cancer of any part of the body spreads through blood and lymph vessels
that cancer which spreads through blood is more dangerous
cancer of skin generally spreads through lymph vessels

days back surprising report taking up mental problems was published in national level newspaper
according to the report approximately one fourth of the population of the country suffers from some or the other type of mental problems in their lifetime
this matter can not be completely true but to consider it guess will also not be correct
in order to search luxury and comfort man may be making progress by leaps and bounds but his brain has to bear lot of harms for this
old and aged children everyone is suffering from various types of mental tension and are coming in the captivities of psychological disorders
even though not all might be taking the advice of psychiatrists or psychologists
but the number of patients coming to the psychiatrist and psychologists today has increased much than earlier
the advice of the psychologists is proving ineffective and modern medicines which suppress the symptoms of the problem are delivering more harm
in the pomp of multimillion advertisements of modern medical science perhaps very few people will accept the truth that methods of effective treatment of common mental problems and severe psychological disorders are present in the ancient indian medical science that is ayurveda
the cure analysis and treatment of psychological disorders are discussed in detail in ayurvedic texts
maharishi charak tells about three types of diseases in sutrasthan of charak samhita nij aagantu maanas
the nij disorders are those which occur due to the imbalance of tridisorders lrb gas bile cough rrb
aagantu diseases are those which occur due to ghosts lrb microbes rrb polluted air and maanas diseases are those psychological disorders which occur due to desires and jealousy
as all of you know ayurveda is not just the method of treatment it is also science of life
in ayurveda not just the symptoms of disease are treated but by treating the root cause of disease body is holistically made healthy
the meaning of complete health is the health of brain and soul together with the body
if the health of any one of the brain or the soul is not good then it is definite for the health of the other to get affected
healthy mind can not reside in unhealthy body
there are three properties of man saatvik rajasik and tamasik these properties are decided on the basis of balance of tridosh and the entire mental health depends on it
the nature of man his judgement and decisive ability the multiplicity of his character till the extent of the entire personality depends on these three properties of saatvik rajsik and tamsik properties
if there is increase in the rajsik and tamsik properties in man due to his food and life style then he can be surrounded with psychological disorders
according to few specialists the entire working system of brain depends on the three properties of desire pride and intelligence
desire has control on brain and desire works according to the dictates of pride
intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all
with the increase of the effect of desire or pride on intelligence the mental balance disrupts mental frenzy and tension get incentive and as result psychological disorders occur
according to charak samhita in the case of mental disorders negative effects affect the eight basic psychological causes of will will intelligence memory feeling devotion morality efforts and behavior
due to this reason man does not stay fit for social life
with the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders
this is the reason why together with consumption of nutritive food excellent digestive capacity is given boundless importance in ayurveda
renowned yoga and spiritual deepak chopra considers radiation and life also important together with brilliance for mental health
according to dr chopra life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body
radiation is that inner physical strength which by increasing our comprehension power helps us in taking the right decision
due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders
one main cause for occurrence of mental disorders for any person is also not being able to strike proper balance with his surroundings
in general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality anger greed delusion jealousy frenzy sadness worry rage fear happiness etc
if the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis epilepsy hysteria obsession illusion delusion unconsciousness excessive alcoholism etc
the way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now
dr deepak chopra says the greatest effect of our mental health is seen on our body
in the same way the good and bad effects of physical health can be seen on the brain
in order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind brain

there are three main kinds of this type of hernia too inguinal hernia affecting the groin region umbilical hernia affecting the navel region and incisional area rising at the place of surgery of stomach
inguinal hernia this is swelling connected to the inguinal canal on the inner walls of stomach and therefore it has been given the name of inguinal hernia
the case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia
it is believed that at some time or the other approximately part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction
the surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common
umbilical hernia is related to stomach
of all the cases of hernia related to stomach approximately to cases are those of umbilical hernia
umbilical hernia is generally due to congenital disorders
in fact one hole of the stomach wall which is connected to the umbilical nerve often gets closed before birth
in some cases this does not happen because of which hernia erupts near navel center
if the size of this type of hernia is small that is less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years
large sized hernia which does not stop on their own surgery is important for their treatment
this surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child
in some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth
but in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak
result the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high
incisional hernia large population has to cross small surgical process of the stomach
due to the reason of this surgery for the cracks to appear in the walls of stomach is also common
gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high
to percent cases of few cases of hernia of stomach are of this type
due to the reason of the permanent weakening of walls of stomach there is chance for hernia to occur once more for second time through surgery
one of the main causes of hernia to occur is the weakening of walls of stomach
this problem can occur due to any one or many of the reasons like congenital reasons due to increasing age as result of surgery strain in muscles during pregnancy reducing weight fast for decreasing obesity diseases like marfan syndrome etc
excessive pressure inside the stomach is also built due to growth of hydrosil growth of tumor in uterus due to pregnancy etc because of which the walls of stomach become weak and the danger of hernia increases
it is very easy to know the symptoms of hernia
during the examination of the swelled surface in the affected areas one gets to see swelling or rise
in affected areas the complaint of pain can also occur
swelling increases on putting more pressure while lifting weight micturition or defecation
swelling becomes clearly visible in some cases by staying standing for long or coughing as well
the pain occurring due to the reason of hernia is very intense
the intensity of pain increases immensely after physical labor or as the day ends
it is not difficult to recognize the symptoms of hernia
generally doctors make an estimate if there is hernia or not through the symptoms told by the patient his family history and the examination of regions like groin navel etc
apart from it generally there is no need of any other test for the cure of this disease to experienced and specialist doctor
where making estimation of the disease is difficult there advice is given to get ultrasound or cat scan done
the aforesaid tests are often important for testing the chances of hydrosil
the only possible treatment of hernia is surgery itself
riddance from this problem can be obtained only through surgery
famous by the name of hernioplasty this surgery is also done with the help of laparoscopy endoscopy etc
in some cases open surgery is also done
for the treatment of hernia the method of surgery which is brought into maximum use these days that surgery is laparoscopy
due to being minimal invasive surgery the surgery is done by putting an incision of only mm to the patient
as result the patient starts walking after few hours of surgery
he gets working in normal way after just two three days of surgery and within to days he gets to his daily works
under this technique of surgery laparoscope fixed with microscopic camera is made to enter the region of hernia through small tube
surgeon gets helped by means of camera in seeing hernia and the adjoining regions on the video screen
by means of another tube entered inside the stomach the surgeon rectifies hernia
the rectification of hernia is done through the posterior part of walls of stomach
netted mesh is sewn on the destroyed area of hernia and this way riddance is got from the problem
with the help of laparoscopy hernia is almost completely safe process
yes in approximately ten percent cases small complications after surgery are certainly got to be seen
generally during hernioplasty there is danger of infection in the region of surgery destruction in the adjoining blood vessels and nerves and harm to the nearby organs etc
where the presence of experienced doctor reduces its danger to minimum there well equipped hospital is capable of controlling them in better way in case of complication
as told you earlier the only possible treatment of hernia is surgery and because of techniques of minimum incision it is also very safe
but from fear of surgery or considering hernia as less serious disease can put the patient life at risk
it is worth mentioning that hernia is such problem which does not get cured on its own and it keeps on increasing with time
if it is left to increase this way then its rectification through surgery becomes comparatively more difficult
in the situation of no treatment supply of blood gets affected due to blood vessels being pressed or due to obstruction especially in veins because of which there is danger of ischamial nephrosis and gangrene
because of hernia due to obstruction in intestines the flow of matter present in them stops
consequently tightness vomiting release of gas actions like discharge of faeces may get affected and immediate surgery becomes essential
in some cases the work efficiency of the organ affected with hernia or its nearby organs get affected and other physical complications start increasing
with no treatment the danger of hydrosil to happen from hernia can also be there
therefore do not delay in hernia
with delay not just the danger of life risk would increase but comparatively there would also be problems in surgery

diabetes is not disease which happens only to aged and obese people
the treatment of diabetes mellitus lrb sugar found in urine rrb occurring in children is far more difficult because the treatment of children is done especially by keeping in mind their physical and emotional condition
in diabetes the quantity of sugar in blood increases immensely because the body fails to produce the insulin being secreted from pancreas
diabetes is of two types
at some point of time type diabetes was called juvenile onset diabetes
this is that condition of patient when the insulin is secreted less or not secreted at all because the immune system attacks the cells of pancreas
this disease may occur with great speed in the age of to years
in type diabetes the body does not stay sensitive to the insulin produced inside it
this disease occurs in extremely obese teenagers who have this disease in their family
type diabetes grows gradually
the symptoms of type diabetes are frequent micturition drinking lots of water dryness of throat laziness high pulse rate and blurred vision
the cure of the disease is ascertained by the test of urine and fasting blood sugar lrb more than mg rrb
for the parents who have children with diabetes keeping their children away from sweets and apart from taking samples to monitor blood sugar seeing them getting injected to take insulin may seem to be very painful but this may have to be done several times in day
in such situation they can get great relief from counselling
you should consider diabetes as an obstinate problem and not disease whose cure will surely be found some time or the other
in order to keep the balance of blood sugar level ok the insulin has to be balanced and for this make the children exercise daily
together with this give him food of this type which has little carbohydrate balanced quantity of fat more fiber and less sodium times day little by little
the teachers family members and kin members should also be aware of his disease
the young people can fight the disease by taking medicines as advised by the doctor and bringing change in the lifestyle
for this they should reform the eating pattern reduce weight and do exercise
keep in mind that you have to make your diabetic child as self dependent as possible so that for him taking injection becomes as easy as brushing teeth
he can learn to do all these on his own by the time he is of years of age
when does eye problem occur
if your child has problem in doing school work
if he feels pain in eyes throbbing pain or tiredness
he does not see the writing on the black board clearly
if he brings his book very close to eyes while reading the book
then take him to an eye specialist immediately
often the teachers of children detect such problems on seeing and make you cautious
important information connected to antibiotic
if your doctor asks you to keep an eye on the symptoms of the disease for hours then follow his advice
if you are said that the child has to take antibiotics for days and in three days only all the symptoms of disease vanish then also do not stop taking medicine before the completion of days
this way by stopping the medicine in between the immune capacity of bacteria increases consequently that problem can again start to grow

our brain of around to kilogram weight seems to be made of soft matter of brown color
our brain is in fact complex mass of thousand crore of nerve cells only
the brain of small honeybee is also made up of these cells only
one unit of brain neuron or nerve cell is complete and independent in itself
every nerve cell has long tail
this tail is as small as mm in some then in others it is as long as thousand mm or one metre
the brain is an infinite maze of several thousand crores of cells and the mutual network between them
on the whole either the pregnancy does not stay in women suffering from tumor or even if it stays then many more complications occur during pregnancy
like abortion premature delivery premature rupture of the amniotic fluid sac dislocation of placenta lrb premature rrb weakening of the foetus in the womb the foetus getting crossed inverted or skewed
the child getting stuck at the time of delivery
the need of caesarean operation for the delivery
complications while the operation need to remove the uterus
excessive bleeding post delivery
getting anaemic owing to excessive bleeding
increase in the size of fibroid
many times the cure of uterine glandular swelling is problematic
the size of uterus also increases in ovarine knotendometriosis pregnancy edinomyosis etc but skilful gynaecologist can easily find out the disease after careful examination
the following tests are important for fibroid
sonography through abdomen or vagina lrb transabdominal and transvaginal rrb
laparoscopy hysteroscopy lrb if needed rrb
lrb if the doctor thinks essential rrb
after finding out the condition of fibroid in the uterus with these tests it can be ascertained by which method it can be removed
mere presence of the glandular swelling is not prerequisite for its removal
if the symptoms are not appearing then the woman can be counselled and can be asked to come for check up after some time this treatment in itself is satisfactory
there is knot and therefore it has to be removed it is not necessary
if the knot is very big and is getting bigger continuously if the woman is panicking the symptoms increase the symptoms of bleeding pain and pressure appear then only it should be removed
if the sub mucous fibroid is small then it can be removed with the help of uterine hysteroscopic endoscopy
the fibroid can also be removed with the help of lasers
there are two types of operations for fibroid
myomactomy lrb removal of knot only rrb this operation is done with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy by doing laparotomy lrb opening stomach rrb
just the tumor is removed in case of young aged females who do not want more children
hysterectomy if the age is not less the tumor is very big and there is no need of having more children then the entire uterus is removed together with the tumor
medication is provided to decrease bleeding and for pain relief and iron is given for treating anemia
some special injection and medicine can be given to reduce the size of the fibroid
gnrh analog lrb decapeptyl or lupride rrb mifepristone danazol are the main medicines
but due to these medicines the symptoms of bone weakness and menopause are produced
the condition becomes as before on stopping the medicine
the modern treatment laparoscopic myolysis lrb through laser ndyyag rrb
the blocking of uterine artery lrb ambolization rrb
in modern treatment the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl particles or gel foam powder through pipe entered through the thigh artery after anaesthesising it
by blocking the uterine artery the blood supply available to the tumor gets obstructed and the tumor reduces up to
skilful gynaecologist is capable of doing proper treatment after considering everything
therefore it is unnecessary to be scared of leiomyoma disease
the investigation of the secrets of brain
if we gradually cut open with saw and separate the upper part of the skull of man after making him unconscious on an operation table then by peering inside we can ourselves see the live brain with our own eyes
similarly neurosurgeons operate the brain by cutting the skull bones with saw and drill
bacterial dysentery occurs from special type of bacteria lrb bacilli rrb
many things are of just the sort as the inner kernel of the walnut seen after cracking it
through the creative capacity or the assistance of the brain itself einstein raman tagore and shakespeare could produce their extreme original and unique ideas
by look so simple but how wonderful is the brain in work capacity
on investigating any part of brain with microscope we will see that it is mainly made of just one type of cell neuron or nerve cell
in bacterial dysentery there is repeated discharge of fecus consisting of blood and phlegm
disease of bacterial dysentery is more rampant in places of temperate environment
the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs more in monsoon season in india
in the main part of the brain all the life processes keep taking place and very small center or nucleus controls all of them in the same way as in any other normal cell
in women men and all the aged people the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs in similar manner
by disrupting the phlegmatic action of the large intestine and the phlegmatic action of the end part of the small intestine the bacteria of the disease of bacterial dysentery produce solvency in them
the matter which fascinated kahal the most that was the mutual network process of the nerve cells
in this immense crowd of cells one cell actually does not touch any other cell
the axon of one appears to be going very near to the other cell but there always remains certain distance between the two
kahal studied these network places with great minuteness which later on were given the name of synapse by sir charles sherrington
how does the information or signal reach from one cell to the other cell
there are special chemicals or neurotransmitters which do the work of messenger in this synapse henry dale and otto loewi made an important discovery by finding acetylcholine
consciously valley has been left between every two nerve cell so that the electric impulse can not cross by jumping over it has to take the help of chemical messenger and then alone the signal can get forwarded
after all why the interference of these chemical substances in the electrical communication system
what is the benefit of this the question is in fact very interesting and important
if we think deeply then this one fact comes up that in this system the information travels in one direction only not haphazard
every synapse gives unidirectional instruction because the chemical substance can be secreted from the end of the axon only
in fact in axon the electricity can be conducted equally from both the directions just like wire
but the direction gets decided at every synapse because the chemical messenger which can cross the valley is present at the end of axon and not in the body of the next cell
thus the signals can never cross the synaptic valley in the opposite direction
without this directional instruction the signals running between the millions of cells from both the directions then will create ultimate chaos
the second benefit is that because of this chemical process there is delay of approximately the thousandth part of second or milli second
this way the signals can be sequenced with respect to time
the more the synapses in neuronal circuit the slower would be the communication in them
synapse has one more use as well
because of one chemical substance coming medially we can easily interfere in the communication system of brain
these chemical substances are called medicines
many medicines given by the doctors today like anaesthesia to make unconscious tranquilizers for inducing sleep and peace and many intoxicating substances affect these synapses only
why the action site of these medicines are synapse and not the nerve cell itself to understand it will not be now difficult
therefore the effect of these medicines are more in those regions only where there is dense net of synapses
the person afflicted with the disease of bacterial diarrhoea suddenly becomes victim of intense stomach pain and dysentery
every cell in itself appears to be very simple as unit but the complex mass of thousands of crores of cells give birth to unlimited possibilities by connecting mutually
perhaps this only is the physical basis of our intelligence consciousness and memory
from the point of view of creation we can divide the brain into many parts
because of being enclosed in box of bones at one end of the body it is not easy for the brain to keep direct contact with all the distant parts of the body
therefore the role of our spinal cord connected with brain in the form of an extension branch is very important
like thick white rope from the neck to the lower part of the back spinal cord is safe in the spinal bones
at regular interval through the medium of spinal nerves from both its sides spinal cord has contact with the entire body
each moment our spinal cord keeps receiving information from skin and other organs and each moment that keeps sending proper instruction to our muscles
the spinal cord finishes many normal work on its own on this basis it does not disturb the brain for everything
for example it maintains proper tension in our muscles so that we can keep standing erect
we withdraw hand when all of sudden pin pierces finger
this reflex action occurs at the level of spinal cord
the simplest and basic example of the work method of nervous system is this reflex action only
apart from this the main use of spinal cord is like highway alone
the entire caravan of all the signals between brain and different parts of the body crosses through this spinal cord alone
thus the consequence of minor injury on spinal cord can be serious
but now let us reach to the brain moving above the spinal cord
the brain starts just as we enter the head
or let us say that the spinal cord gets converted into brain
on seeing it appears as if the brain is like very big walnut resting on strong stem or branch
therefore we can divide the brain into parts
one is this straight stem or brain stem and the second is the main part or cerebrum resting on it
in fact brain stem seems to be similar to the spinal cord and it is also situated in its straight line but it is divided into three parts if we see attentively
the lowest most part is medulla oblongata very small and common in appearance but very special in importance
the various centres which control our internal life processes are present in this alone
like breathing beating of heart controlling of blood pressure digestion of food etc
sudden jerk or injury on the medulla can therefore lead to death in moment
but there is nothing to get scared in this
nature has placed this very important controlroom in very safe place at the center of the head
at times in scooter or road accident the neck gets jerked very severely and medulla stops doing its work on getting damaged
the ordinary looking injury becomes the reason of immediate death
the same happens when the criminals are hanged
medulla alone is the originating place of out of cranial nerves as well
the cranial nerves control the muscles of face tongue shoulders etc bring auditory signals from the ears and controls many other internal organs
if we cross the medulla oblongata from top then pons and midbrain come
midbrain and pons mainly work as junction
in way here many small branches emanate from the main stream of nerves or highway
similarly branches go to the cerebellum lrb mini brain rrb located at the back of brainstem
like skilful computer cerebellum does two very important jobs
first because of its support only we are able to maintain our balance by standing on just two lags
we do not fall even when fleeing running doing acrobats bending forward backward
second this cerebellum only adjusts all our voluntary actions very minutely
cerebellum does their fine adjustment with the voluntary actions
earlier we mentioned cranial nerves out of which had their origin from medulla
similarly more emanate from pons midbrain
their work is to control the muscles responsible for rotating the eyes and to carry sensation from the face
now after crossing the brain stem we reach the most huge and main part of the brain cerebrum or forebrain
on crossing this line one gets to feel very important difference
from the unconscious state we have come to the conscious state
from darkness to light
we have no intuition of whatever is happening in the brainstem or cerebellum
as if we are sleeping in very deep sleep
but just on reaching the level of cerebrum we become awake
we start feeling comfort sadness
we feel that we are doing all the works willingly and not like machine
we start saying am there am doing am liking it
does any machine feel like this
none of the organisms have as developed cerebrum as is ours
let us forget for moment the difference of small and big and place the brains of mouse and brain close by and see
the brain stem and other parts appears to be similar in both
and why should not it be after all both have to control respiration heart food blood pressure etc
while jumping and running the rat also has to maintain the balance of its body
but when we look at the cerebrum we can feel that there is huge difference between mouse and man
our cerebrum has become so huge that it has almost covered all other parts of the brain
because of this surprising growth of cerebrum the brain of man seems to be the biggest in proportion to body
although the brain of whale and elephant are certainly bigger than ours
the weight of brain of our closest relative monkeys is just half kilogram
the weight of the brain of whale is th part of the total weight of its body while the weight of our brain is around th part of the weight of our body
if the bodies of whale and man are made equal then the human brain would look bigger even more than times of the brain of whale
there is one such speciality in cerebrum which has been riddle for us even now
this is divided into two parts which we call the right and the left cerebral hemispheres
there is very small bridge connecting the two corpus callosum
strange thing is this that the right hemisphere is connected to the left half of the body and controls that alone while the left hemisphere is connected to the right half of the body
all the nerves traveling to and fro have to cross the middle line to go to the other side
this very system is found in all the organisms
the effect of an injury in the right half of the head is seen in the left half of the body
similarly on pricking needle in the left hand its pain can be felt by the right cerebral hemisphere
like modern office in the cerebrum also the division of labor has been done in very good manner
the upper thick surface of mm is called cortex and the maximum nerve cells accumulate in this only
in the rest inner part the net of wire like nerves are spread
the small masses of some cells only may be seen somewhere in middle
the most posterior part of this cortex does the work of vision while very small part at the center does hearing
the system of olfaction is at the lower surface
though this part in man has become very unimportant in comparison to animals like dogs
but we should not forget that neither light nor sound or smell can reach in the brain
only the electric impulses are reaching there through the nerves
so who is seeing hearing everything while sitting in our cerebrum
is one more small man is sitting inside the human brain
this is complex riddle by which since time immemorial both scientists and philosophers are being perplexed
approximately cm wide and cm long strip on the surface of the central part of the cerebrum is called motor cortex and all the muscles of the other half of the body is being controlled from here alone
the representation of body here also is inverted only head down and legs up
what is the secret behind this chaotic system even no one knows this nicely
it can happen that one day you may solve this mystery
similar strip near the motor cortex is called sensory cortex where all the sensations from the other half of the body come
touch heat pressure pricking everything is felt here only
but how this we feel pain in finger when thorn pricks but not in head
but if thought attentively the sensation on being produced in the finger nerve reaches sensory cortex after crossing spinal cord and brain stem at great speed
then only we realize pain
the pain is in finger this is only natural illusion so that we immediately protect our own finger
roughly we can conclude this that our nervous system works in the same way as any telephone system
if the wire gets severed in the middle then the entire communication of that area gets disrupted
similarly the moment nerve between the brain and any organ gets severed the transfer of signals stops that very moment
we can not move our hands and feet even if we feel like
this is called paralysis
nothing has happened to the muscles not even to the motor cortex
only the one which establishes the communication between the two has been cut
similarly now even if we prick needle in the finger or burn it we will not feel any pain
similarly we can easily estimate as to what could be the consequence if any part of the nervous system gets injured or any disease occurs
in today mechanical era this is only natural that we compare the various organs of our body with the instruments used in day today life
we say that heart is like pump eyes like camera nerves are like electric wires and brain
quickly the answer would be that the brain is computer
today at every place whether classroom or shop office or home the assistance of machines are being taken to do simple calculations
we have loaded the burden of our brain on these calculators and computers
our brain as well as computers also can do the actions like multiplication division addition and subtraction
but are the methods of both same
in future could such advanced super computers be made which would have intelligence and consciousness like us
does the brain and computer have the only difference of small and big or do they have some principle differences between them which is not possible to obliterate
such interesting questions today are of pervasive importance
in the efforts to solve the questions on one the hand the development of computers is getting lot of help as well
right there on the other hand we have also started to understand the secrets of brain in better way
due to contact with machines we have also understood this that for understanding the complexities of any big instrument in better way we should first make its small and simple model
in schools and colleges also children must be encouraged to make models of aeroplanes steam engines radio etc so that while playing they should get familiar with the basic construction of these
why not we study small model of brain before understanding an incredible computer like the human brain
we should make child and computer sit together and ask both of them to do the same work multiply by and whatever the answer comes go on multiplying that with again
the computer will start working according to the instruction and it will continue working till the time we do not switch that off
but the child will throw away his paper and pencil in few minutes and will in fact start questioning you oh why are you making me do this useless work
what does this mean am tired leave will not do anymore
if we still insist him then he will start doing mistakes while he also very well knows the methods to multiply same as that of computer
the child soon gets bored with useless work
there is unlimited variation in his thinking not definiteness like computer
he will suddenly find out new solution to any question which no one had told him before
will any computer start thinking about gravitation like newton when an apple falls on it
or on providing with all the information about strange animals will it find out the theory of evolution like darwin
one more interesting thing is that the ability to commit mistakes is also in brain alone not in computer
many times we commit such mistakes while speaking
the professor of oxford william spooner is very famous for this
thus it is also called spoonerism
at present some scientists are engrossed seriously in studying about this as well as to how these mistakes occur in brain
if we see with an all pervasive point of view then many times in laboratory some of our mistakes only have given birth to new inventions
it is clear that there are some special qualities in man like intelligence consciousness prudence etc to which the best of today computers have not been able to reach
in future it will ever be able to reach there is doubt in it
but there are also such things in which the computer seems to be more dexterous than our brain and here lies its actual usefulness
the computer can do any calculation very fast while we will take years to do the same work when sitting with paper and pencil
the computer which plays chess made by dr hans berliner selects the most suitable move from moves on analyzing them in just second
till that time we will not even be able to count up to five
that is why in controlling fast moving spaceships rockets and aeroplanes we have to depend on computer
similarly many important calculations today are so long and boring that it would be problematic for us to finish them
now after entrusting this job to any computer the scientist can pay attention to more comfortable and satisfactory aspects
in one more context also if we want to transfer in computer then this can be done in few hours only
the way in which today another cassette can easily be prepared from the recorded music of one cassette
but if we want to transfer the entire knowledge accumulated in one human brain to another human brain then how much time will be taken
is it therefore that we have to spend years on education in schools and colleges
no matter how advanced or clever the computer is it does only that work whose process we are aware of and which we have made the computer learn
whether has to be added to or to solve the complicated integration of the modern physical science our brains alone will teach the computers the methods to solve them
our brain has programmed the computer but who programs our brain
opposite to the normal congenital reflex actions this newly learned antireflex actions may only be established at the level of the most developed part of the brain that is cerebrum
therefore these have the maximum importance in man
by making the reflex actions present by birth as base we go on adding new links on them one after the other
pavlov started thinking if this is also one of the types of what we call education
perhaps this only is the base of our exquisite ability to communicate mutually through systematic language
first we point to child moving elephant on road and say that see that is elephant
then just by seeing the picture of elephant the child soon starts recognizing it
finally only on seeing the word elephant written on paper the image of elephant forms in his brain
is it not matter of surprise because there is absolutely no kind of similarity between the word elephant and that huge black quadruple having long trunks
it seems as if language is the highest achievement of the human brain
can the present human society be imagined without language
is science history or business possible if we are not able to tell each other our thoughts through language or not make them permanent by writing
scientists at present are trying to make our closest relatives chimpanzees learn the language but it is clear that compared to us this ability is negligible in them
in the past few years roger sperry has amazed everyone by doing some very important experiments directly on human brain
while receiving the nobel prize in stockholm on december he told in his speech that the beginning of all the studies started with those patients who used to get very intense epileptic strokes and no medicine was benefitting them
when there was no way out it was finally decided as to why should not the corpus callosumthe bridge connecting both the cerebral hemispheres be cut in the middle so that at least the unwanted excitement occurring on one side should not spread to the other side
the daring with which this operation was done much more surprising than that were the results
though we certainly get description of twoheaded animals and demons in ancient stories but no one knows as to how will person with two brains or split brain think actually
in the words of roger sperry if person with split brain attended party six months after the surgery then no one was able to see any abnormality in him
both the hemispheres of cerebrum continued fulfilling their responsibility by controlling the respective halves of the body
but after an indepth study this surprising conclusion was clear that there is huge difference in the capabilities of both the hemispheres
everyone at least know this that the ability of both of our hands are not equal
in maximum people the straight or right hand is much stronger and dexterous
the same thing has also been seen in all the animals
it can easily be estimated by this that our left hemisphere is more effective and like class monitor it has command over the other hemisphere
but when roger sperry severed the contact between the two hemispheres then how special is the place of each in our mental activities was estimated for the first time
if we consider the subjects being taught in the school then the division between hemispheres would be like this
left hemisphere language lrb speaking cognizing the meaning of the words written and heard rrb maths analysis of problems estimation of time
right hemisphere geometry painting instrumental music organization of facts estimation of space
whatever we study in class generally gets accumulated in the right or left hemisphere according to this area division
but because of being connected with corpus callosum the knowledge of one is always available for the other when needed
on the contrary the matter of the patients of roger sperry is in fact indeed exquisite
whatever one cerebral hemisphere learns the other does not get to know anything about that
as simple example if pin used to be pierced on the little finger of the right hand and afterwards he was asked to now demonstrate with the left hand that in which finger did he feel the pain then he used to be left dumbfounded
the contact of left hand is with the right hemisphere and it has no knowledge of the piercing of the pin
with how much vigor and hard work scientists are engrossed in studying our brain and how thrilling are their experiments
one attraction of science is even this that all of us can participate in its birth
in any huge class some students would be uncommon
that is instead of playing writing eating with the right hand like all of us they would be using the left hand
these left handed players however have distinct grandeur in cricket
what is their ratio in your school or classroom
in what subjects do they get more marks or in what do they take more interest how is their speaking ability
if we consider the whole school then is there any difference between girls and boys small kids and adults in this respect
but firstly in order to measure everything we have to decide some or the other physical scale
to reach at any authentic scientific conclusion is difficult without this
breast cancer is scary name for women
thousands of deaths can occur if breast cancer is not detected in its initial days
maximum succumb financially to breast cancer
the patient gets tortured by the fear of physical deformity and the chances of the disease to appear again even when the life is saved on late detection at the increase in the seriousness of the surgery
if cancer is detected in the initial condition only then treatment is possible without any physical deformity even the patient also can be made disease free cent percent
this way lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and physical torture
in contemporary phase rapidity has come in the spread of breast cancer due to changes in the social and lifestyle habits
many methods of cancer detection like mammography mri ct scan are useful though till now but some or the other way the ill effects of radiations becomes visible
in such situation the doctors have got hold of new weapon infrared thermography
in infrared thermography breast cancer can be tested as soon as possible without lethal rays
greek and egyptian medicos knew the relationship of this disease and the temperature of the body
sir william herschel had discovered infrared and heat dissemination in
but till it was not certain whether infrared can be used the field of medicine
on passing the rays through the prism the area which is below the red color of the light spectrum gets the maximum heat where we do not see any light
in this method infrared detector on receiving infrared wave energy converts it in electric signals proportionately
this ratio is in proportion to the temperature of the targeted organ
electromagnetic wave energy is converted to electronic video signal through one of its instruments
different pictures are obtained in different diseases and healthy condition which on recognition the disease is diagnosed
breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in the very initial days and helps in quick treatment
of course confirmation from other laboratory methods is certainly important
because of less information in it it is easy to read thermography in comparison to mammography
lacs of women can be benefitted with breast thermography
the use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of the narrowness of the blood vessels in diabetes etc
several times the disease occurring due to physical relations takes very dangerous form and gives birth to many other lethal diseases
any disease which spreads due to physical relations is called std that is sexually transmitted disease
neck cancer and many other cancers can occur from std
some infections together with the complications related to womb disease of liver may even lead to hiv aids
there are approximately types of sexually transmitted infections
std spreads through bacteria parasites and virus
out of them some of the std which spread rapidly are as following
hpv that is human pappiloma virus is viral disease
hpv disease engulfs around of the total people who make physical relations
the infection of hpv is of more than types and types of infections out of these spread through sex
hpv infection engulfs men more rapidly in comparison to women
on being infected cauliflower like warts appear near genitals and neck of the uterus hips or neck
for protection from hpv infection do not make relations with an infected partner if possible
even if you make relations then also use latex condoms
complete riddance from hpv infection can not however be obtained
but by burning the warts too with the help of medicines one can get relief
genital herpes is also viral infection which occurs in those who make relations with infected partners
genital herpes is of two types
after the genital herpes infection inflammation or wounds erupt near vagina or phallus which causes pain
genital herpes infection spreads not only on making relations but also by touching
apart from this in women this infection also gives birth to diseases like vaginal discharge
in order to get protection against genital herpes infection do not make relations with multiple partners
even by using condoms while making relations it can not be stopped therefore do not even make relation during infection
if pregnant woman is afflicted with this then while delivery she may pass this infection on to her baby
syphilis is bacterial infection
syphilis affects lips mouth kidneys and genitals
apart from an infected partner syphilis can also pass from pregnant mother to her child
in the initial symptoms there are small inflammations which do not pain
at times swelling also occurs near lymph nodes in which there is no itching at all
many times people ignore it
these inflammations are not permanent that is they keep coming and going
therefore many times they are not even diagnosed for years
apart from diseases like aids syphilis infection may also lead to diseases like blindness mental imbalance and heart attack
many times even deaths occur because of syphilis infection
if you are infected and pregnant then you can even lose the child
for safety together with condoms pay full attention to hygiene also
get the infection checked at regular intervals
if the infection has spread then immediately get the treatment done
with the help of injection one can control it within hours
tykomonosis infection spreads through parasite
the main symptom for this is the green and yellow vaginal discharge in women
apart from this itching near or inside vagina with discomfort at the time of micturition is also common symptom
there are no symptoms for this infection in most of the men
but many times burning sensation inside the phallus is the symptom for tykonomosis
pay full attention to hygiene and get check up done regularly
according to dr preeti maximum std are bacterial
for safety against std if together with correct information attention is paid to some common things then the chances of these can be decreased
health and regular check up
generally most of the women do not get regular checkups because of which they have to face dangerous diseases afterwards
generally in girls pap starts occurring after the age of years
the white discharge happening to girls generally after menstruation or at times even before is only called pap
it is not important to get pap test done before making physical relation but the test must be done after the gap of years
the pap test generally must be done regularly after the age of years
but still on getting greatly involved in sex the pap test must be done from the age of years
pap test is of two types
leukoria test is done to find about common infections
leukoria test completely depends on physical relations
those women who are unmarried or then those who do not get involved in sex they do not need the leukoria test great deal
pap infection test is also of two types
one which is simple test with its positive medicine only the complication can be controlled
second hyper plasia is the second important test for pap infection
with hyper plasia pap infection test it can be found out if there is any cyst in the ovary or not
the doctors generally advise for hyper plasia test to women of years
the homeopathic doctor minu mehta says that women should get hyper plasia test done right after the age of years
though if pap test is done continuously every year right after establishing sex relationship then protection can be obtained from dangerous diseases like cervical cancer
liquid pap test is done for this
breast cancer is engulfing indian women very fast
according to recent survey maximum women become the victims of cancer because they do not take their health seriously right from the beginning and considering slight tumors etc as normal ignore it
according to dr pankaj kumar of rajiv gandhi cancer hospital women should include mammography as well in their regular health check up
women of years should get mammography done once every third year
not just this together with this one should also do bsf or breast self exam
breast self exam should be started right after the age of years
normally doing bsf may keep you vigilant for breast cancer but you must certainly get mammography done on having any node unwanted pain or any type of secretion
the hormonal changes start happening after the age of years because of which the size of the ovary starts increasing or else there is persisting fear of the formation of cyst in it
thus getting ultrasound done every year is very important
the treatment of any disease occurring due to cyst or hormonal changes can be started immediately by this on being diagnosed at the right time
after an ultrasound if cyst is found in the ovary then immediately get its biopsy test done
with the help of injection some sample of the liquid material of cyst are taken in this test
after its the test it becomes clear whether that tumor is cancerous or not
though biopsy test is part of your regular checkups but still on getting cyst or node because of hormonal changes pain in the lower abdomen sudden growth of hair on face increase in weight and irregularity in menstruation you must get this done
often after crossing women stop paying attention towards their health
they feel that now they do not need any regular checkups but this is not proper
there are many such diseases after which may take awful shape on not taking precaution
the fsh test must be done at that time when menopause is about to start or has already started
in fsh test one can be saved from the diseases happening at the time of or after menopause
pelvic exam test must be done annually
with the help of pelvic exam test any changes occurring in uterus reproductive organs bladder etc can become known
if any kind of unusual change is happening in these then it can be known through pelvic exam test
one cholesterol must be checked regularly after attaining years
if you are less than years and you smoke then you take the advice of your doctor regarding this as to when you should get your cholesterol test done
not just this if you have obesity or the disease of fatness then you should get the cholesterol test done after
maximum women in india give birth to children till the age of years
after delivery white discharge takes place from the body of women in very large quantity
because of this lot of calcium comes out of their body and by becoming weak the bones break on slight injury occurs
although years is the age for the test of osteoporosis but keeping the health in mind get it done every year after second or third delivery
bone densitometry is also done for calcium
by the bone densitometry test the quantity of calcium is found out
after the age of years the danger of colon cancer increases in women
although the cases of colon cancer are seen less in india but still regular checkups is important
every year fobt test should be done for colon cancer
sample of human fecus is taken in fobt test
after the fobt test it becomes clear if any type of blood etc is coming in your stomach or not
flexible sigmoendoscopy must be done once every five years
by flexible sigmoendoscopy it becomes known whether there is any type of swelling or not in your liver stomach or reproductive organs
colonoscopy must be done once every years
that is one at then second at years of age
there are some more tests apart from this whose regular checkups is not essential but still get them done at some interval
these tests are blood pressure diabetes depression and obesity lrb fatness rrb
poiseuille in last century came to know of an important fact about the flow of any fluid in tubes
if the radius of the tube is increased twice then the flow of water in it increases times
because of this reason by only making the radius of vessels in our body more and less our blood pressure and the supply of blood in any of the organs is skilfully controlled
if you are playing hockey or participating in any race then your normal blood pressure of increases very much so that the supply of blood becomes fast
it also becomes clear from this that because of the muscles present in their walls our vessels can constrict and dilate as per need
if in place of our vessels there were pipes of steel then would they give service for eighty and hundred years without getting rusted without getting broken
many times with increasing age and many different reasons like smoking cigarette chewing tobacco obesity eating excessive salt mental disturbance deficiency of physical labor the elasticity of the vessels decrease it starts contracting
this only will be called high blood pressure or hypertension which has become common disease today
nature has created our vessels only for bearing certain pressure
if the pressure on them is constantly very high then it would have bad effect on their walls
as result of the blood pressure our main organs would get damaged at the end brain heart and kidneys
but it is not essential that medicine must be taken if the blood pressure is measured slightly high
otherwise first we should see if there is any reason in our life style which can have ill effect on the blood pressure
if you take two simple roller pumps in place of the two halves of the heart auricle and ventricle then you can do the entire task of the heart
impure blood comes in the right auricle through the two main arteries which is sent to the lung for purification by the right ventricle through an aorta and one aorta from the posterior part of the body
both the main arteries open in the right auricle
if we want that blood does not go in the right auricle and ventricle then we will have to do one thing
one tube each will have to be put in the dorsal and ventral main arteries
in short the blood will come out through them and the right half of the heart will be completely empty
medical surgery does this only
if we connect these tubes which come out of the main arteries to the tube of the roller pump and switch on the motor then the blood will start flowing ahead
blood is sent to the artificial lungs for purification
artificial lungs are also very simple apparatus
glass vessel full of blood in which oxygen is released in the form of bubbles
there is special arrangement so that lather do not form by the bubbles of oxygen
without the help of roller pumps and artificial lungs also the flow of blood can be kept going
heart lungmachine is made up of such roller pumps and artificial lungs only by which the most complicated of surgeries are also possible
the heart pumps nutrients and oxygen to the entire body
the heart too needs fuel for its work
the heart can not take nutrients from the blood filled in its chambers
close to the origin of the aorta two coronary arteries originate which get divided on the surface of the heart like minute branches
coronary arteries distribute oxygen and nutrients to the heart
the meaning of coronary is coronation and these arteries are spread like crown on the heart
the amount of work which the coronary arteries do for the heart and body then it is correct for it to be decorated with crown
on the obstruction of these coronary arteries one gets heart attack
the collision of ultrasonic energy with various organs getting reflected and taking photograph of this is only called ultrasonography
these days there is discussion about ultrasonography
but the knowledge about the technique of usg started right from the beginning of this century
it was seen at that time that on putting minute pressure on some special substances one type of energy is released
which is calles piso electric effect and this effect became the base of usg
in this process transducer is that part which emits ultrasonic energy for moment and then catches the reflected rays back
instrument like computer makes its picture with the help these waves which is imprinted on the photographic plate
with its help proper treatment is done by doing medical cure
the popular belief which is more in the minds of people is that the use of usg is done mainly for the problems of infant baby and its mother
but it is not like that
stomach is like closed pouch inside which gall bladder liver intestines kidneys lymph glands spleen etc are situated
similarly in the cage center of the chest ribs heart and lungs are situated
for the cure of the diseases occurring in these organs situated in these closed boxes normal or special usg is important
normal or special usg save the patients many times from the difficulties of surgery
liver is very important organ of the body
the more this organ is important the more are the diseases found in them
the infections of liver cyst normal tumors or else the lethal tumors of cancer the clear cure of all can be done through ultrasound
similarly if the blood has clotted in the spleen or there is lymphoma cancer then its diagnosis is also done through ultrasound
the kidneys are as important for the normal functions of the body as the heart
because of the lifelong working of kidneys only it is possible to remain alive
whether there is kidney or not if there then whether it is working properly or not or if there is any type of cyst stone swelling pus this also is told to us by the ultrasound test
till some time ago in order to find this xray was taken by injecting dye in blood which used to take lot of time and it was also painful
the problem of thyroid gland is also very common
for the study and diagnosis of thyroid gland also there is less need of using radioactive elements due to ultrasound with which both the treater and the treated have less dangers of radioactivity
the diagnosis of all the diseases like parathyroid prostate adrenal etc is possible through usg
one very important use of ultrasound is for the diseases of womb especially for cancer
it is believed that mammography is not inferior in any way to the popular xray mammography
it gives cure in cases
usg mammography is comparatively simple and it saves the patient from radioactivity
the extent to which ultrasonography is useful in the test of foetus in the womb is not anywhere
whether the foetus in the womb is twin or not whether the organs of the child are forming properly and the whether the foetus is developing all these are found from the usg test of the uterus
many serious complications are found in the foetus like the nonformation of the head or even the water getting filled in it lrb hydrocephalous rrb etc
ultrasonography gives clue to all these problems
apart from the correct information about the foetus one more important information which found through usg is in the matter of placenta
the properly formed foetus may also get destroyed by some or the other shortcoming or defect of the placenta
by ultrasound all the deformities can be detected the status of the placenta any bleeding from it or if there is any calcification etc
by which the doctors can act in time and save the foetus
by usg that is ultrasonography lot of help can be obtained can be obtained in the detection and diagnosis of the disease in the field of medicine
very important help is received in the testing of foetuses and organs
so important simple and omniavailable technique today is being wrongly used for hideous work
every one must have heard and many women must also have got advice that they should get ultrasonography sex determination test of their foetus
in some form or the other we participate in the predelivery sex determination test and female foeticide and the destruction of half the population due to materialistic reasons
because of cataract crores of people world over are deprived of eyesight
cataract disease is connected to age and often this makes the people who are more than years of age as its victims
on getting hurt in the eyes or due to any other disease cataract can occur or else this may be congenital disease or disease occurring after year of birth
the rate of blindness due to cataract is more in our country in comparison with the western countries
according to the blind control in india there are blind people in the country out of which people are victims of cataract
though this blindness can be rectified through surgery
the natural lens inside the eye starts getting opaque in cataract by which the eyesight gradually decreases
this is called white cataract
in the initial condition though there is improvement in sight by the use of spectacles but with increase in cataract one feels the need to change the spectacles
after condition there is no improvement even on changing the spectacles
at present the only permanent solution for this is surgery
to make the surgery of cataract even more comfortable very new technique has been developed which is called phaco emulsification technique
to take out the cataract with the help of the technique of phaco emulsification small incision of mm is made
through which energy is given by the phaco machine and it dissolves the cataract inside and sucks it out of the eye
now through this small incision foldable lens is fixed in the eye which opens on its own after entering in the eye
since this incision is very small therefore there is no need to put suture to this
thus it is called the suture less surgery
the special benefit of this surgery is that the person can see clearly from the very next day and he can go to his work after day
he is finally given the number of spectacles after week while in the suture surgery he is given the number after two months
the surgery with phaco machine is done with utmost care
to do this the doctor is needed to establish harmony between both his eyes both hands and both legs
one leg operates the phaco machine and the other focuses the surgical microscope for eyes
one hand handles the needle of phaco machine the other hand fills cataract in this needle by the instrument
expensive machines are used in the technique of phaco emulsification
therefore phaco emulsification technique is costlier than normal surgeries
phaco machine is proving to be boon for the patients of cataract
the surgery done by phaco machine is easy painless and can be done in less time
you can imagine that it is possible to take out any object from inside the body without putting an incision on that part
especially such objects which are very hard and is hidden deep inside the body like stones of urinary tract and calculus
more than lac people are infested with stones of the urinary tract and everyday there is constant increase in their number
till date surgery was the only treatment to take out the stone but several complications used to crop up in that
but now technique which is called lithoptysis has become available to take the stone out without surgery
the technique of lithoptysis was used in for the first time and from it has become available in india as well
in the lithoptysis technique the stones present in any part of the urinary tract are targeted with aim and then the stones are broken by the shower of high capacity waves
the pieces of stones then come out alone with the urine
today it has gained credibility as the most safe simple and theoretical procedure
if the diagnosis of the disease of the patient has been done then there is need of some common blood and urine tests xrays of the kidneys and ibp xray
generally there is no need to make the patient unconscious in this process
the action is completed without pain by just numbing the treated organ and by sleep inducing injection
the time required in the lithoptysis technique depends on the size of the stone and its number
generally this is done in one episode
one episode in this is of minutes and gap of days is maintained so that unnecessary rays do not fall on the body
when these rays collide with the body then often no sensation is produced
some patients may be feeling slight piercing but there is no pain
most of the patients can return home immediately after the treatment
as an exception one may have to be put under vigilance for hours
post treatment the patient has to come back again for treatment after months
then by taking new xray it is seen if any part of stone has been left back or not
since the practice of lithoptysis technique has only been years information about its long term effects have not been gathered
of course in complications immediately after treatment bleeding in urine and feeling of intense pain in micturition are included
approximately of the patients get complete relief by the technique of lithoptysis
in some the action may have to be repeated twice or more
the expense at every sitting amounts to nearly thousand rupees which includes the stay at hospital as well as the fee of the doctor
presently this facility is available in cities in our country
in lithotripsy there is no need of surgery or incision
you can start the normal daily life in week
the action can be repeated if the stone forms again
the technique of lithoptysis can easily be adopted for those patients who have been declared unfit for surgery like aged patients of diabetes blood pressure or heart disease
the problem of uncontrolled micturition
in women the urinary opening is between genitals and anal opening
the tract at the center of the urinary opening from the urinary bladder is straight and small
babies and kids do not have control in the state of urination and the urine comes out on its own when the urinary bladder gets filled with urine
maximum children acquire control on urination by five years of age and urinate at the right place only
they stop wetting clothes and bed
not having control on urination and the clothes getting spoilt are common problems in women
it has been known through researches that the problem of clothes getting spoilt due to not having control on urination is found to be to in the age group of years to in age group of years of age and to in women of years and more
the complication of not having control on urination may become severe in different women
permanent treatment is possible in women or else control is obtained through treatment
the complication of not having control on urination the problem of leaking on its own may occur due to the reason of diseases of urinary system or the various diseases of organs situated close to it
urine may come out on its own when pressure is exerted on urinary bladder urinary system when there is tension due to coughing sneezing or wearing excessive tight clothes
the most common problem of women is the problem of urine leakage
if the muscles of urinary bladder are hyper active then the muscles may get contracted on filling of slight volume of urine in urinary bladder and the clothes may get spoiled
this problem may occur because of the destruction of the nerves of urinary bladder
but in several women its cause is not diagnosed
this problem may occur in some due to mental tension
women often try to control urine for long time
the urine comes out on its own from the urinary bladder on being accumulated more than its capacity or it getting filled with urine when the capacity is less
clothes may also be spoiled by not having control due to some structural defects in urinary bladder urinary tract
if from the urinary tract the passage of urine is created through the rectum lrb fistula rrb or genitals then also the problem may arise
there is an imminent danger of the formation of fistula because of complex long stuck delivery
though maximum women try to keep the problem as secret but the treatment of this problem is possible
the doctors try to find out the root cause through investigation and essential tests
to find out the reasons the help of tests like the test of urine bed rest measurement of the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder the speed of the flow of urine the pressure of the leakage of urine ultrasound xray ct scan etc is taken
the solution of the problem is dependent on the root cause
if the women are infested with the infection of urinary system then by consuming proper antibiotic medicine the women can get rid of the problem very fast
if there is any abnormality of fistula or structure then the rectification of these deformities is possible through surgery
if there is obstruction in the urinary passage then there can be the need to broaden or opening it
if the problem is to not being able to have control on urination for long duration then by the treatment of problem the quality of life can be improved
if the cause is not diagnosed then the treatment is possible through behavioural techniques medicine and surgery
if not able to have control on urination then the consumption of water liquid and drinking substances should be done in limited quantity
do not consume tea coffee carbonated drinking substances or it should be done in as much less quantity as possible along with it
reduce the weight if the weight is excessive
if infested with any type of allergy cough constipation then get the treatment done
do exercise of pelvis and stomach
mental tension is an important reason for not having control over urination
tension worry are lethal for the physical and mental health
stay away from these as much as possible live life happily free of tension and worry
in these women urine gets leaked on because of the reason of exerting pressure coughing sneezing
if relief is not got from the above mentioned efforts then they should do exercise of hips and muscles of the lower part of the pelvis
various methods of treatment have been developed in these patients
if these increases the will power in patients then also relief may be got from the problems
these patients get relief in by using the instrument placed close to the genitals by which the lower part of the urinary bladder gets support
similarly plugs are also available in the foreign countries to block the passage of urinary opening or else injections of dense sticky substance is also put in order to block the passage in the urinary tube
if relief is not obtained from the above mentioned efforts then women can become problem free through surgery
because of not having control over urination in the state of hyperactivity of urinary bladder women stay in haste their urine can leak
this is the second most important reason of not being able to have control on urination
if this complication is because of the diseases of nerve cells then proper treatment of disease is essential
if the cause is not known in these patients then they must be given training to have control on urination
stop urine for definite time and the duration must be tried to increase up to hours gradually do some exercise of hips and pelvis along with it
control on urine is done through the medium of brain spinal cord and nerves
if the will power is made strong the idea is repeatedly revised in the mind that am capable of having control on my urinary system then control can be obtained
around also get relief by exciting the muscles of pelvis by electric waves
many medicines are available as solution to these types of problems
they are advised to take anticholinergic or antidepressant medicines
problem in the outflow of urine on excessive filling of urine in urinary bladder obstruction in passage damage of the nervous system consumption of antipsoric medicine or mental tension may be the reasons of habit
by finding the root cause treatment should be done
if the problem is serious then women can urinate at regular intervals by putting tube in the urinary tract or the urinary tract of these can be broadened or the treatment is possible through surgery
unable to keep control on urination self leaking feeling hasty is common problem in women and their quality of life is affected because of this
the complication of leaking of urine on exerting pressure may occur in to adult females
but the problem is not untreatable women can become problem free by changing the life style habits doing exercise of hips and pelvis medicine treatment by surgery and other techniques
therefore these should not hesitate should not feel embarrassed should lead healthy normal life after getting treated by taking advice from skilled doctor
this discomfort can arise generally by peeing in the public place drinking less water and not cleaning the genitals properly
the complaint of urine infection can occur both in men and women but this complaint is found more in women because the inner part of their genitals stays open
slight dirt showing carelessness in hygiene wearing dirty panty repeatedly or wearing wet panty give birth to urine infection and may give discomfort of many days to the person
therefore every person should stay beware of it
the women should especially pay more attention to the hygiene of their body
those women should stay even more careful who have already faced this problem once
when the menstruation stops after the age of
after the age of the smoothness of the vaginal tract diminishes and the walls start becoming thin because of this then the chance of infection increases very much
the distorted form of urine infection is swelling in the vaginal tract and micturion with discomfort
in urine infection urine comes with obstruction and burning sensation
the stream of urine being distorted and not straight intense burning sensation around the place of urine onset of fever
in the condition of less urination the doctor puts urinary bladder and tube
the reason for intense inflammation around the place of micturition is indeed the growth of coli bacteria
the occurrence of urinary infection in females may be common thing but it is quite shameful and uncomfortable
not peeing at public places and drinking lots of water and cleaning the vaginal tract wearing clean panty is important so that one can continue to stay safe from this uncomfortable disease as much as possible
after intercourse with husband the vaginal tract must be cleaned with water till inside so that inner cleanliness is maintained
light easily digestible food carrot papaya cucumber gourd guava etc should be eaten lot in food so that the stomach should remain clean and there should not be any constipation
lots of water should be consumed
the cancer of skin is generally of three types
squamous cell cancer basal cell cancer melanin cell cancer
the melanin skin cancer is the most dangerous of all the three cancers mentioned above
while basal cell cancer is the least dangerous
the cancer of skin generally appears in the form of small tumor
this tumor can appear on any part of the body
like hand leg face etc
the tumor can be of normal color or of black color
in the initial stage the tumor is painless and therefore we commit serious mistake because there is no pain in the tumor
therefore the patient does not pay attention towards the treatment of the tumor
when the tumor grows pain develops in it and then on showing to the doctor it is found out that the tumor is of cancer
which has spread in other parts of the body as well
at times cancer appears in the form of small wound
the problem is again that in condition of cancer occurring in wound generally there is no pain
the patient does not pay attention to it as it does not pain
the cancer of the wound increases and stage comes when pain starts occurring in that
but by this time cancer is already spread in other parts of the body
at times cancer appears in hairless tumors
therefore do not forget any tumor
no matter if it is proved by the tests that the tumor is not harmful but when cancer would occur in such tumors this is not known
still if harmless tumor persists in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms
formation of wound in the tumor rapid growth of tumor pain in the tumor change of color in the tumor
if any of the above mentioned symptoms appear in any of the harmless tumors then be cautious and immediately consult the doctor
cancer of any organ in body spreads either through blood or through lymph vessels the cancer which spreads through blood is more harmful
because they spread very fast in all the organs of the body
definitely get tested each tumor appearing on the skin
if tumor persists for years then in the situation of the growth of the tumor getting tested is must
if pain starts happening in the tumor of the skin then get cautious and definitely get the test for cancer done
if wound appears in tumor then also getting attentive is important
each such wound appearing on the skin which does not get healed in weeks signals towards cancer
generally the cancer of skin spreads through lump vessels alone
therefore generally the cancer of skin spreads very slowly indeed
the skin of the place which has cancer from there it goes to the nearby lymph gland and from there it then goes to central lymph glands
treatment of the cancer of the skin along with the cancerous skin the healthy skin is also cut and removed
by which the danger of cancer being left back is removed
at times along with the cancer infested skin the lymph glands are also cut and removed
it depends on the rapidity of the cancer whether cancerous gland has to be removed or not
carelessness should not be towards long persisting wound towards warts and painless tumor towards genitals
the cancer of the skin of the genitals is different from the cancer of the skin of the other organs
although the beginning of cancer starts just with tiny tumor or wound but the tumors and wound stay hidden beneath the skin of the genitals and by the time it is diagnosed it becomes very late
at times this delay is also due to the hesitation in talking about the matters of genitals
not only cancer but other diseases of genitals also continues to grow due to hesitation and its proper treatment does not take place
in the condition of cancer of female genitals the skin of the genitals are cut and removed
if the cancer has spread up to the lymph glands then the lymph glands also have to be cut and removed
the meaning of arthritis is swelling of the joints and more than different types of swelling of joints have been put under the category of arthritis
arthritis disease can take in its captive at any age
arthritis disease is seen in children as well
the arthritis disease is common thing in people of years and more
the arthritis disease in them occurs in grim condition and is more painful
as the age increases the cases of arthritis also increase and out of every people have been seen as the patients of arthritis in the age group of less than
if the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis is not done in time then by this lot of harm occurs to the joints and bones of the body
in fact arthritis is disease affecting the women world over
repeated
repeated
repeated
repeated
which along with being shock absorber also reduces the friction of the bones
but in the patients of arthritis this cartilage weakens due to abrasion or else gets fully damaged because of which intense pain in the joints weakness is felt and swelling also occurs
repeated
because of the damage to this cartilage the arthritis infested patient faces difficulties in activities like walking climbing up the stairs and sitting down or taking bath by sitting on the ground
generally if there is persisting pain in joints of knees elbows ankles shoulders neck hands etc and if there is intense pain in normal activities like walking getting up from the chair bending while working or bending to pick something from down then the signal of this matter should be understood that the time to consult the doctor has come
because of arthritis not just there is swelling and stiffness in the joints but several times redness is also seen in the joints
if the correct diagnosis of arthritis is done in time then relief from the disease is possible to very great extent
the meaning of quick treatment is less damage to the joints and because of this the patient has to suffer less pain
generally the advice of surgery is also given when the arthritis becomes serious
similarly the patients in whom arthritis has reached the initial stage
for them the options like unicompartmental knee resurfacing and hip resurfacing are very beneficial
in condition of arthritis affecting the entire joint the total hip replacement lrb tkr rrb is useful
the meaning of tkr is not this that metal implant is fixed by removing the knee of the patient
in fact in the tkr procedure new layer is put at the end of the bones
in this way the knee becomes totally safe and complete bending and bowing becomes possible
knee transplant is the latest technique in which the patient gets relief in various activities like walking bending while gardening sitting while driving or exercising climbing up and down the stairs
in the context of our country it takes new meanings as well because the joints have important role in several types of daily activities like bending or sitting on the floor
bending up to degree is possible by high flexion knees and the patient can again come back to his daily routine
the patients who have already got the rotating platform high flexion knee transplant today experience much more satisfaction and they can finish their daily activity in much better way
the riddance from an epidemic like arthritis can be obtained by proper medical care options of surgery and by adopting balanced life style and proper habits
and the patient does not have to undergo the suffering condition of pain and decrease in the physical activities
apart from medicine and surgery balanced diet also plays an important role in combating with this disease in better way
the important things which should be kept in mind in matters of food are as follows
increase the quantities of vitamins minerals antioxidants and nutritive substances and by doing this you can keep your weight under control
the state of arthritis becomes severe by the increase of obesity
consume more and more of fresh fruits and vegetables and especially eat more vitamin rich fruits like apples oranges cherry peppers tomatoes beet root sweet potato etc so that the joints stay protected
with fibrous food like whole grain barley and brown rice also one gets help in maintaining health and especially joints
refrain from taking fried food
consume more and more of calcium rich food lrb like diary products dry fruits soya milk fish rrb etc
calcium rich food keep the bones safe
eat such food by which vitamin stays in the body
our body does not produce calcium that is obtained from food
by doing regular exercise also the muscles around the joints become strong
the density of bones increase by this and the abrasion of joints also decrease
the habit of alcohol spoils the life of the best of men
being irritated of their habit the family members constantly keep trying that from anywhere they should get such treatment by which the addiction of the drunkard turned member can be removed
at times this situation is such that the drunkard on getting fed up of his own bad habit thinks of quitting alcohol
in such situations they start seeking support of such solutions by which they get harmed in place of being profited
even after having different types of treatment they get sadness alone
help is also taken from the rehabilitation centres but there is limit also for those who help in coming out of the cyclone of intoxication
in getting rid of the intoxication of alcohol will power of the drunkard works more than treatment
even if the family members of the drunkard take him forcibly to the alcohol rehabilitation center and there his treatment is started his treatment would not be successful till the time he himself develops the desire within himself that he has to quit alcohol
naltrekson is such chemical which block the opioid receptors situated in the brain responsible for the feeling of happiness received from intoxication after drinking alcohol
apart from taking naltrekson in the form of oral tablets it can also be taken in the form of injection
but it has been proved by the experiments that taking injection is more effective
since naltrekson is intoxication preventive in the purest form therefore till the time it is there in the body no type of excitement would be felt by him on doing any type of intoxication
the special mixture of naltrekson is made to reach metres beneath the skin by making an incision of cm in the lower part of the stomach or behind the arm
the benefit in this condition is this that on not taking the medicine by the patient or on forgetting to eat medicine the medicine continues to show its effect
in naltrekson implant also it is important that the patient is kept under the naltrekson treatment for at least months
often it happens that those who get oral treatment done they stop the treatment in middle
while the treatment should last for at least year along with it the quantity of alcohol is also reduced
one can get harmed by the consumption of any intoxicating item be it alcohol or smack or any other intoxicating item with naltrekson implant
in bacterial dysentery the body becomes weak after becoming skinny and fever starts developing
in the extreme case of bacterial dysentery there is repeated tendency of releasing fecus in the patient but each time very less fecus is discharged
in bacterial dysentery together with discharge of fecus vomiting also takes place and the patient feels extremely thirsty
in bacterial dysentery the tongue gets dried extreme deficiency of water molecules and the symptoms of food poisoning becomes visible
in the fecus of the patient of amoebic dysentery entamoeba hystolytica are found and in the stool test of bacterial dysentery bacteria are found
in the preventive treatment of bacterial dysentery also it is very important to protect edible and drinking items from the flies
in order to be safe from the bacterial dysentery the fecal release should be done at definite place and phenyl should be used regularly at such place
the patient suffering from bacterial dysentery should be kept warm in bed
the fomentation of turpentine on stomach is beneficial in bacterial dysentery
if contracted bacterial dysentery only boiled water should be used for the first hours
the other treatments of bacterial dysentery are similar to amoebic dysentery
rabies is viral disease which happens in mammals generally by the biting of dog or other animals
the central nervous system gets affected by rabies and if not treated immediately the death of the patient is inevitable
the virus of rabies gradually reaches to the central nervous system through the medium of peripheral nervous system
the effect of rabies takes up to several months to appear
on the basis of its location in the uterus it is of three types
sub mucous intramural sub serous
this can be one or more than one in number
remove
night blindness is disease of eyes
when sonography is done because of some other reason then it is found out that there is tumor in the uterus
major among other symptoms of fibroid are
in day time everything is clearly visible to the patient of night blindness but at the night time he is not able to see even the nearby things clearly
in night blindness there is discharge of white color
in night blindness the eye lens appears to be consisting of minute hole and triangular shape becomes visible behind the cornea

if the new born baby is of less weight is in sick state then it should not be distanced from his mother
his entire care should be done in front of his parents only
by parental touch or by taking it in the lap the tension of child decreases
national family planning program was started in the form of sponsored program by the government
the aim of national family planning program was to keep the population steady in the face of the needs of the national development
the main aim of the family planning program was to reduce birth rate right from the beginning in order to achieve this aim for which the various techniques of family planning was to be encouraged in the masses
the meaning of birth and child health point of view is to accept unanimous and composite view towards the issues of contraception and motherchild health
solid methods to control population growth
population growth has been the chief problem of the developing countries
in order to stop population growth immediately very solid steps have to be take
firstly it is needed to attack poverty
appropriate success can not be achieved in this direction without removing this factor mainly responsible for population increase in countries like india
the nation looks infested with scarcity from all the four sides
baldness is not disease
at present there has been flood of the centres for treating baldness in big cities
generally hair starts falling due to high fever typhoid syphilis influenza and lack of blood etc
generally baldness is genetic condition but it begins mostly in the head with the start of itching and irritation
it has often been seen that the hair of year old men falls gradually and after some time they become bald to great extent
therefore it can be prevented in the beginning with safety measures
it happens very fast in women of less age but the situation of complete baldness arises very less in them
this is scientific fact that the hair of healthy people grow everyday and in the place of hair that fall during combing new hair grow on their own from time to time
various skin diseases like herpes ringworm make such layer on the scalp that the hair starts falling and baldness comes
the use of cosmetics like oils to prevent hair fall and baldness the soaps to wash head make such cases even more serious
staying in intense light or staying in sunlight for long special types of beautifying cosmetics and techniques like bleaching and curling of the hair etc encourage baldness
special hair designs in which the hair is twisted and broken and making pony tail especially while sleeping at night and by putting needles and rings in the hair etc may also become the reason of baldness
because of deficiency of thyroid the hair start falling by becoming thin weak and dry
along with keeping the body healthy with nutritious food the hair can also be made beautiful dense and strong
unbalanced diet not just stops the continuous growth of hair but it also makes bald very fast
because of any ups and downs happening in the life hair start falling and complete baldness may also come
during pregnancy and after pregnancy the falling of hair in women is common thing
tiredness and tension are the chief causes of heart disease so it also has large impact on body and hair
some professions also do not stay away from affecting the hair
the hair of thirty year old man in england was found to come out in bunches while his hew hair were also growing
after the chemical tests it was found that the quantity of mercury was more in his blood vessels because of which his hair used to fall
it was found after enquiring that mercury was used in the industry in which he was working because of which the mercury slowly diffused into his body gradually
because of eating habits the hair often falls
because of excessive feelings and being emotional disorders occur in the head and it is natural for the hair to fall
increase of weight or obesity is chief health problem
most menwomen be it adults or youth are tensed with the increasing obesity or increase in weight of their body
if the increase in weight and obesity becomes hindrance for the activities of the body then actually it becomes matter of concern for every person
normally the main symptom of obesity is that the height of the body should be in proportion to the weight of the body
if the weight is more than the physical height then the body is fat otherwise the body comes in the category of being thin
two main reasons of weight and obesity have been told under the health science
first genetic meaning by descent
second because of food habits meaning activities related to diet
eating more than hunger not doing exercise or physical labor leading life of lethargic etc come under this
people who do not do physical labor and exercise along with the less flow of blood in their body in places like belly hips and waist
cholesterol lrb fat rrb accumulates in the blood carrying vessels as result of which diseases like high blood pressure indigestion heart disease and diabetes occur
at present as the consciousness of people are increasing towards healthy life and pure and plain healthy diet and exercise people are becoming aware of the dangers owing to increase in weight and obesity
the diseases owing to obesity are also becoming subject of concern for people
advice of reducing weight and obesity is given by the doctors to the patients of high blood pressure diabetes and heart disease
the women escape from food which increase weight and obesity and practice self control in order to keep their body slim and attractive
it is generally seen that in order to reduce the weight of the body and not to let obesity come the lasses take very less food under dieting and do unnecessary exercise
by doing unnecessary exercise several times harmful effects are seen on the body
the other problem which comes by this is that if the weight of the body is more or less than required then along with ill effects on health weakness may also arise in the body
in the report released by world health organisation it was indicated in that among the ten chief dangers for health the biggest danger is that of the reduced weight
if the weight of the body reduces without dieting or without exercise then this also is considered to be the symptom of serious disease
it is important to take the advice of the doctor prior to dieting
it is essential for the body to get complete nutrition according to the daily needs because of which it can work well and there should not be any weakness
the following matters have to be paid attention to in this context
the harmony between food and habits is must then only the effort towards the direction of reducing weight obesity becomes meaningful
the body construction and the food related needs of every human being is different according to his actions
copying someone or comparing oneself with the other is waste
some food items like fast junk food fried substances come under the food of negative calorie
the hunger does get satiated by eating food items like fast junk food
but the body does not get any benefit from this
gradually one should try to evade it by strong will power
dieting is done by several girls and women to reduce their obesity and weight
positive results of reducing obesity come forward
the person who is dieting should diet after taking proper consultation
there are many dangerous diseases in the present world tb malaria disease of heart cancer tension and hiv etc
these diseases are more dangerous than sars these diseases have caused the death of more people in comparison to sars
then also sars has attracted the attention of more and more people
there are many similarities and difficulties in sars and other diseases
it is important here that sars has emerged as new problem this is new disease which is noncurable
sars is spreading due to infection
sars today is the synonym of that disease which occurs due to corona virus
because of sars disease the infected person gets high lrb degree fahrenheit rrb fever
dry cough starts coming and there is difficulty in breathing
sars is called hyper active respiratory syndrome
the initial symptoms of sars resemble pneumonia
but if sars is not diagnosed in time or there is carelessness in treatment then death takes place
the history of sars is not very old
the recognition of the disease was done for the first time in china
the first patient was discovered in aeroplane on february
the symptoms of the patient infected with sars are illusionary
the infected person gets fever of degree fahrenheit or more and he also feels cold with this
headache and vomiting starts happening
breathing becomes difficult in the patient
the symptoms like pneumonia appear
the one who is attacked dies in three six days
in the whole world there is situation of illusion regarding the patients and the symptoms of sars
thus suspect case and probable case have been defined
the formula to stay constantly healthy
uncountable types of bacteria and virus are spread in our atmosphere
by the medium of our breath we pull in thousands of bacteria and virus with the air into our body and then also they do not have any ill effect on our body
at times when our immune system falls weak due to some reason then only we become infested with flu or coughcold or any other disease or allergy
with food also we make several disease bearer microbes reach our body
such microbes mostly die when coming in contact with the saliva of our mouth or else the acid of our stomach
if by any reason this does not happen in the body of any person then he is troubled by the poisoning of the food
after all why does it happen that in similar situations some people fall sick while some other people continue to be healthy
how does the immune system work
at first the body protects us from the external disease causing agents
type of antibacterial substance continues to be produced on our skin by coming in contact of which there is destruction of various types of disease causing bacteria and microbes
the nature protects us by other means as well
our mouth nose and eyes also become the way of entry into the body for the microbes
the saliva in the mouth is antibacterial
layer of mucous is spread over the nasal cavity and the lungs
the microbes which do not die immediately they become inactive on sticking with the mucous
there is type of enzyme in the mucous and the tear that flows from our eyes which is called lysosome
lysosome by breaking the wall of the cell destroys the disease causing bacteria
the beneficial bacteria named lactobacillus staying in the intestines and genitals saves us from yeast and the other harmful microbes
this way our immunity works as protective shield against the mischief of just any disease causing microbe
if by any reason any antigen like the disease causing bacteria virus fungus parasite or any other external substance enter in the body by penetrating the upper protective shield then the immunity action of cells and humoral begins
the scientists believe that apart from the other parts there are three different types of cells and three other soluble proteins in the immunity system
the cells and proteins can be seen in the blood flowing in our body
the cells and proteins together become capable of initiating the immunity activity
there are three main types of cells red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes white blood corpuscles or leukocytes and platelets or thrombocytes that is the cells which coagulate the blood
worm this is common disease in children
objectively the worms are of several types round worm magnetic worm thread worm tape worm and other diseases of worm
round worm affects children the most
the symptoms of round worm
less hunger stomach pain mild fever chattering of teeth micturition in bed cough itching in anus and many other abnormal symptoms are of worms
at times the round worms come together as unit and produce obstruction in the intestines
because of round worm there may be pain in the stomach and vomiting
the hook worms get stuck to the intestine and they reduce blood there by sucking it from there
the eggs of round worm reach the intestines through polluted food and blood
the round worm become the cause of several symptoms after maturing
the eggs of hook worms hatch on warm and wet ground and their embryos reach the thin blood vessels by penetrating the bare feet of human body
tape worm reaches the body by eating contaminated meat
their diagnosis is possible by stool examination
similarly naru is also type of contagious disease which occurs by drinking unclean water of ponds lakes tanks etc
the water in rural areas is generally available from these sources only
thus naru disease is generally found more in rural population
the naru worms reach the digestive system by drinking contaminated water where the naru worms come out of the cyclopes and enter the tissues of the skin and begin to grow
the worm generally produces wart in that part of the body which often comes in contact with water
in such situation the naru worm releases its larva in the water
the symptoms occurring due to naru worms are generally seen in the lower part of the body
the part of the body where the worms come out there is intense itching and then inflammation occurs and then hole forms
because of this the symptoms of high fever headache and vomiting appear
in order to prevent naru disease the water of tanks lakes and ponds etc should be used only after filtering
the diagnosis of naru disease can also be done by putting some chemical injections in bone marrow
the disease which spread through the microbes related to water
in this disease several types of malaria filaria dengue and yellow fever etc are included
the disease of malaria spreads from one person to the other through total of four sub species of mosquitoes named plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax plasmodium ovale and plasmodium malaria
in the symptoms of malaria there is high fever nausea headache and very profuse sweating
by affecting the pancreas and nervous system malaria becomes the reason of loss of consciousness and at times death
generally the mosquitoes bite at night
the disease of filaria spreads because of the bite of mosquitoes named culecs pipians at night
dengue yellow fever and other microbial infection spreads through another sub species of mosquito named andes egyptys
aedes aegypti mosquito spreads yellow fever mainly in the urban regions by communicating virus from one person to the body of another person
in the chemical composing of water the roles of nitrate fluoride and arsenic are very important in the ascertainment of the suitability of the drinking water
but its high density may lead to the growth of various lethal diseases in the ling run
or it enters our body through the medium of water and then it gets converted to nitrite
this nitrite again reacts with diamine amide and carbonate and forms nnitroso compound which is very cancerous
for the ascertainment of the suitability of fluoride rich drinks the role of fluoride is also very important
on consumption of long term or excessive fluoride rich water many types of disease occur in man and cattle
the disease occurring due to the excessiveness of fluoride is called fluorosis
polio eradication program problem and solution
polio is such disease which is not lethal but by making the people handicapped it makes them abnormal for the entire life
in this disease affecting in childhood generally the growth of legs stop and they are left small and thin
consequently polio infested person has to walk as lame person or with the help of crutches for the whole life
often the patients of polio become fat when the age increases because of which their problems increase even further
the reason of polio disease is polio mellitus virus
in order to free india from polio mellitus virus and to save people from becoming victims of polio in thousands of number every year the pulse polio program was started by the world health organisation which was established in april
the pulse polio program was started on an experimental basis for the first time in delhi in
being encouraged of the reach of pulse polio and the support received to the pulse polio in delhi this program was executed in the whole country in
till now there have been several rounds of pulse polio program in the whole country
the main aim of pulse polio has been only this that no child should be left devoid of taking polio vaccine in hilly places desert places forest areas or in any far distanced places
the pulse polio program will continue for three more years now
as result of the comprehensive mission for the eradication of polio in the number of new cases in the whole country has only been
even after that because of the continuing pulse polio program the number of new cases in came down to
in this number had reached to and by october only new cases came within the grasp of polio
at the same time in there were only six such states where new cases of polio were witnessed
out of these more in uttar pradesh lrb cases rrb and after that cases in bihar had come forward
the government had organised the pulse polio vaccination day only twice in but due to the increase of the number of polio cases to now the polio vaccination is being done times
till may th whatever cases were registered for polio in the whole country the maximum out of them were found uttar pradesh and were found in bengal
apart from these in bihar in madhya pradesh in rajasthan and in delhi are included
by august total of cases had come forward in the country out of which were of uttar pradesh of bihar of maharashtra and one case each of tamil nadu karnataka delhi andhra pradesh and west bengal
the government had aimed to eradicate polio from the country by
on september case of month old girl has come forward in jabalpur
there has been increase in the type of polio and type of polio has also not been destroyed from the roots
in cases were registered in the whole world out of which cases were found in india
it is known that because of the increase of the cases of polio in india it has to face criticism from those countries of the world who have eradicated the disease of polio within them
according to the ministry of the centre for family welfare the virus of polio has now become limited to some selected districts of uttar pradesh and bihar
because the virus of polio is found only in the body of human beings its complete eradication is possible
for this in order to ascertain the abundance of substances lrb antibody rrb to fight against polio in human body dose of two drops of sobin vaccine is given through mouth and the dose of salk vaccine is given through injection under polio immunity vaccine
india is country of huge population
percent population of the country stays in rural areas where the health services present are of extremely low standard
this is the reason that the infant mortality rate is very high in india
although the reasons for infant mortality are various and different
pulse polio mission is national health safety child mission under the family welfare department of indian government in which in order to keep children of less than years polio free medicine is made to drink free of cost
the main purpose of pulse polio mission is to make the children free from physical handicap
the main base of this mission is to make the pulse polio mission reach to every house and giving the medicine lrb vaccine rrb to each child up to years
for which the indian government makes the mass aware through the medium of advertisement
pulse polio mission is actually team work in which there is equal contribution of each member
according to the survey of the world health organisation more than crore people fall ill due to malaria every year and more than lac patients die
malaria epidemic is contagious disease
malaria spreads from mosquito named female anopheles
mosquitoes are omnipresent and diseases like dengue chickengunia and filaria lrb eliphantiasis rrb also occur from these
in malaria disease fever comes following chills and also following sweating
days after the biting of the mosquito the symptoms become visible and the person falls sick
because of being an infectious disease it can also occur from one person to the other person
apart from chill there is also vomiting in malaria
there is intense headache in malaria
the patient may even die if the treatment is not done immediately because by this the fever rises up to degree fahrenheit
after the infection there is lack of blood in the body of the person and the liver and spleen grow large
abortion may also occur in pregnant women due to malaria
female anopheles mosquito lays its eggs in stagnant water like ponds lakes wells rivers drains etc
these eggs are very small and they keep floating on the surface of the water
generally the eggs and the larva which come out of the eggs thereafter get place to hide behind the grass or the plants by the side of water
larva comes out of the egg in hours of the laying of eggs
larva gets converted to pupa in days which start taking dips in water
in or days it flies away becoming an adult mosquito from pupa
adult mosquito rests at degree angle from the surface
this way while becoming mosquitoes from egg their enemy is gambusia fish which eats their eggs in the state of larva pupa
tank kept open on the terrace near the house useless thrown tyres cooler kitchen garden fountains for decoration pots and vases broken vessels uncovered vessels disposable glasses stagnant water near hand pump or tap wells which are not brought into use cistern of animals the stagnant water in the paddy fields the accumulated watering the monsoon season in the tantrum of the trees the lakes surrounded with grass marshy land and the stagnant water of the drains are the shelter place of the mosquitoes
malaria is an omnipresent problem
there is no permanent solution to malaria and neither have the doctors of the world discovered its any inoculation
still for safety against mosquitoes you may get mosquito proof nets fixed on the windows and doors of your house
certainly put mosquito net while sleeping at night
put the repellent cream on the uncovered parts of the body
in the evening burn the smoke of the leaves of need or the incense stick which drives the mosquito away
wear such clothes on body by which the whole body remains covered
least number of mosquitoes will bite by this
in order to stop the breeding of mosquitoes do not let the water accumulate near the house change the water of the cooler every week
do not let water accumulate in the broken vessels kept on the terrace
certainly put gambusia fish in ponds wells and lakes
at the onset of malaria fever get the patient blood tested
high blood pressure is dangerous for health
blood pressure is not such an illness that can not be controlled
by adopting course of abstinence and medicines it is possible to prevent the serious consequences of blood pressure
blood pumped from left chamber of the heart circulates in the arteries spread throughout the body and it is the very pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries by blood circulation which is called blood pressure
the pressure generating in the systolic lrb shrinking rrb stage of heart is called systolic blood pressure and the pressure generating in the diastolic lrb expanding rrb stage of the heart diastolic blood pressure
the systolic blood pressure in normal person is less than and the diastolic blood pressure is less than of mercury
blood pressure of normal man should be less than
we call it increasing situation of systolic blood pressure on systolic blood pressure going above mercury and increasing situation of diastolic blood pressure on it going above mercury
in any person either of the two blood pressures the systolic or diastolic can mount up or both the blood pressures can increase together
these are all named high blood pressure
for the health of person it is necessary for his blood pressure to be normal
there is pressure on heart as blood pressure mounts up and also there is adverse effect of it on the different parts of body
whenever there is decrease or increase in the pumping capacity of heart there is defect in valve of the heart blockage in the main arteries emerging from the heart or vessels have contracted in the whole artery system and blood circulation is abnormal then blood pressure starts mounting up
hormones oozing from some special endocrinal glands in the body also play an important role in the blood pressure increase
blood pressure also increases in case of disease in kidneys or their veins
such blood pressures are called renal blood pressure
though blood pressure can occur to anyone in any stage children youth middle aged or aged but generally disease of high blood pressure occurs more in individuals above years of age
in the last decades changes brought about in lifestyle food habits stressful lifestyle and luxurious lifestyle which is increasingly becoming so on daily basis have played an important role in increasing high blood pressure
get these tests done in case of high blood pressure
the general test of blood and urine
test of lipid profile
the test of blood urea and creatinine
test of blood sugar
test of serum protein
test of and heart
diet of high blood pressure patients
patients of high blood pressure should never use alcohol cigarettes tobacco paan masalas
patients of high blood pressure should use less salt in eatables
patients of high blood pressure should not use much fat in food
for patients of high blood pressure mustard oil is good option
patients of high blood pressure should consume fibrous eatables and green vegetables more in their food
instead of tensed hectic and tiring lifestyle patient of high blood pressure should adopt satisfactory system and must complete night sleep of hours regularly
patients of high blood pressure should do light exercise on regular basis or should develop habit of strolling and walking for minutes in the pure environment of morning
collective feeling emerges in the patients of high blood pressure by contributing in the small domestic chores and the need for labor also gets fulfilled
medicines for high blood pressure
in the modern medical world best of the best medicines of high blood pressure are available but their use should be done with advice of the doctor
generally after blood pressure is controlled people stop taking medicines but doing this is meddling with health
medicines of high blood pressure should be decreased increased or stopped with the advice of an expert only
sound sleep balanced nutritious diet daily routine and light exercise play an important role in controlling high blood pressure
the fast food culture growing in children and in the family is contributing lot in promoting high blood pressure
there is need of control on the high blood pressure increasing fast food culture
causes of high blood pressure
obesity there is chance of high in more fat people
use of salt use of much salt boosts high blood pressure
some other elements potassium calcium magnesium etc are also some such elements that play their part in blood pressure
saturated fat its excess is an accessory to high blood pressure
wine the use of it increases blood pressure
environmental pressure also encourages high blood pressure
contraceptive pills an accessory to high blood pressure
genetic factor may also be cause for blood pressure
harms of high blood pressure
problems like heart attack heart failure may occur due to high blood pressure
problems like kidney disease and kidney failure may occur due to high blood pressure
due to high blood pressure there is bad impact on the sensitive and important parts of body among which the eye and the brain are mainly included
there could be an ill effect of high blood pressure on retina of the eye and disease like paralysis may also occur
diabetes appropriate lifestyle can also prevent from diabetes
diabetes occur due to increase in the amount of sugar in the body
after being sick in diabetes its effect also befalls on other parts of our body with which other diseases also emerge
on being afflicted with diabetes the amount of glucose in blood increases more than necessary
in case of natural activity of insulin formation being closed in the body of the diseased person or the effect of its activity not occurring on the cells parts of the body and tissues can not use glucose easily
entry of glucose is facilitated in the cells of human body through insulin and cells can use this glucose for energy and this glucose is made in the pancreas situated in the stomach
circulation of glucose in blood happens through the liver by which tissues like brain muscles and fat are discharged
on being afflicted with diabetes either insulin is produced in very small amount in the body or its effect on our blood cells does nt occur in suitable amount
diabetes has two prototypes
type diabetes which occurs chiefly in children and in less than years of age
in this the insulin factory shuts down and the need of insulin arises for the child afflicted with disease to stay alive
type diabetes this happens due to person irregular lifestyle of which carelessness in diet to keep sitting body being bulky are main
in fact regular exercise in lifestyle change in food habits and by losing weight danger of diabetes can be stopped
by bringing change in food habits and loss in weight prevention of heart diseases related to diabetes can also be done
in the treatment of diabetes to follow food habits related remedies is very important
in situation of not complying with advice related to food habits any amount of insulin or medicines can not help
generally in the meals of indians carbohydrates and vegetarian content is more in amount and use of fish is also done among the people of coastal region
if still prey to diabetes then the reason is this that they do nt have the right information about their diet
for appropriate food habits or for preparation of proper diet chart diabetic patient should consult dietician
gradually decrease the amount of calorie intake in food better still reduce calories every weeks and how long can you continue decreasing it also depends on your body weight
prepare food chart in which include small and moderate diet
diabetic patients should consume minimum cuisines of oil
reduce quantity of sugar fats and salt as well
if you are vegetarian then increase the amount of fibrous food content in your food
if you are nonvegetarian then consume plentiful fish and completely avoid vanaspati ghee
reduce the use of cooking oils also
in organic fruits and vegetables quantity of antioxidants and minerals are more which are beneficial for health
fish is also great source of fatty acids
stop consumption of alcohol because by this also amount of sucrose in blood increases in horrible manner
risks for diabetes
family history of diabetes
increased body weight
weight of body should be according to body height
by sitting around much also weight increases
malnourishment in childhood less body weight with birth
harmful effects of diabetes
obesity hyper lipidemia high blood pressure heart related diseases stomach protruding out increase in waist or hip size is also harmful
exercise to keep the body fit and fine sugar should be used as less as possible and diabetes should be kept in control
walking around for minutes at fast pace at least thrice in week is good
also remember this that exercising more than necessary can also cause harm
prostrate enlargement common problem of the middle aged
in people above the age of years problem of is common case
for the treatment of in new method of surgery neither cut is needed to be made in the stomach nor does the patient has to stay in hospital for many days
prostrate gland made of muscles has composition exactly like that of the shape of shirt and surrounds the urinary passage like collar
in the prostrate gland milk like white fluid substance is made which is carrier of sperms
with increase in age itself the size of prostrate gland also starts increasing
the increased state of the prostrate gland is called
although it is natural condition of increasing age it is still disease which can affect our life and with which physical and mental problems both can happen to the patient
in disease repeated urge to urinate is common symptom so its reason is that prostrate gland is very close to the urinary bladder and stays surrounding the urinary passage
when size of prostrate gland increases its pressure is also exerted on the urinary passage due to which urinary passage contracts and becomes thin and small
as result urine is able to come out easily and patient starts facing problems while urination
symptoms of disease
because of swelling in prostrate gland and its increase in size two kinds of problems happen in urination
one difficulty to urinate due to pressure in the line of flow of urine and second due to contraction in urinary passage and accumulation of urine an infection happens in it
after that there is swelling in the wall of the urinary bladder
due to these complications variety of difficulties start happening to the patient
like repeated urge to defecate urine urge to urinate at night effort while urinating at start and not only this urinating drop by drop and having pain while urinating
the complaint of pain occurs when there is infection in urine
because of this complaint of stoppage of urine also occurs and relief is felt only when rubber tube is applied to take out urine
in this type of patient there is difficulty to completely empty the bag of urine and after urinating also some amount of urine remains in the bag
treatment of disease
if much enlargement has not happened in the size of the prostrate then to do the treatment neither medicine is needed nor surgery
in advice of drinking less water while sleeping at night is given
if there is habit of drinking alcohol then advice of leaving it is given
not only this patient is also given advice to leave tea coffee etc
if after this also the patient does nt get relief then medicine is given to reduce action of muscles of prostrate gland
new method of surgery
nowadays treatment of prostrate is being done by many new methods whose names are and
and there is no similarity in results in treatment through all three that is why all are not popular together in these
nowadays are not in use
on the other hand treatment of prostrate through the use of laser beams is being considered the first choice of therapists
in the treatment of prostrate is quite popular and most urologists are using this method
this is the reason that is called gold standard procedure
after hours discharge is given to the patient and only after rest of days patient can do his daily work
in method telescope is made to enter through the urinary passage and prostrate is seen through the help of light and lens attached to it
in method telescope stays attached to video system
there are many advantages of surgery by method
in surgery by method patient is given discharge from the hospital after to hours
in surgery by method necessity of making cut in the stomach of patient is not needed
in surgery by method because of less time of the patient staying admitted chances of infection become quite reduced
during surgery by method there is less bleeding
in surgery by method patient recovers after only to days
on treatment of prostrate by method after few days there is complaint of clot of blood coming in urine of patient many times
the complaint of appearance of clot of blood is common problem which can be seen in surgery of this kind
this happens due to rupture of small blood vessels during surgery
secretion increases on blood pressure increasing extremely getting fit of cough or in state of excessive infection
many times this problem is seen years after surgery also
if there is mistake in detection of disease because of some reason then after later on it is prostrate cancer and its surgery is done
in such situation the part of place of surgery becomes stiff like stone
the turning of the part of place of surgery becoming stiff like stone occurs because of cancer having spread reaching into the third stage
when the growth of cancer reaches the fourth stage then it also takes the bones in its embrace
the other problem of this surgery is that of the flow of urine becoming reduced
to get rid of this problem therapist puts rubber tube in the urinary passage of the patient that helps urinate
after few days tension in it goes away on its own because of the tube
increasing havoc of asthma in childhood
asthma is form of allergy
in this the ultrasensitive breathing tubes contract on coming in contact with allergycausing elements
the chest muscles have to work more hard on breathing in and breathing out during respiration through contracted breathing tubes
due to this sound of whistle starts coming from chest
due to swelling in the mucous membrane of breathing tubes and increase in secretion of its glands problems like cough and phlegm also happen
due to contraction of breathing tubes in children during asthma they have more distress as compared to elders
the breathing tubes of children are thin and capacity of lungs is less
in some children the symptoms of allergy start reducing on increase in age and they become healthy by the age of years
in some older children other than viral asthma attack can occur due to sensitivity towards smoke tobacco smoke cold sun etc also
in other children asthma attack can happen due to laughing and crying
gradually these children can become sensitive to dust animal skin fiber strands hair body waste etc and on coming in contact with these asthma attack can occur
at nearly around years of age allergy is produced by pollen grain to these sensitive individuals
in some children attack occurs due to some specific food matter
the main causes of asthma
to an extent allergy and asthma are also hereditary
if parents are allergic then the chances of children being allergic are more
besides this on being hereditarily sensitive attack of asthma can occur on coming in contact with increasing polluted elements present in the environment being allergic to smoke or other chemicals of motor vehicles and factories
dirt dust smell of house smoke of fuel can produce asthma attack in children
the chances of city children versus village children to be asthmatic are more
environment of cities is more polluted
the children whose guardians or other members of home smoke inside the house chances of those children to be asthmatic are more
because of being afflicted with disease repeatedly children with asthma generally get physically weak
the physical and mental development of these children could also be hindered
the solutions of disease of asthma
exceptional development has taken place in the treatment of asthma
with use of appropriate caution and medicines control over disease can be obtained
by being careful and care also the physical and mental development of the child take place in normal way
give regular medicine to child with asthma according to the therapist advice
get their examination done at regular intervals
to reduce the chances of allergy asthma in future children should be fed on mother milk
also do not give solid food to babies for months
after this gradually start giving fruit vegetables first and then grains
in children brought up drinking mother milk chances of allergy are less as compared to cow milk drinking children
make the small children lie down on soft cotton bed sheets and cover them
if the child is asthmatic then do nt make him sleep on dusty bed
entire preparation of letting smoke out of the kitchen should be done
in children asthma can occur due to allergy by animal hair skin hair excrement etc also
if the child is asthmatic then do not let pet animals inside the house
give minimum amount of ice cream cold drinks chocolates chaat fast food etc to children victim to asthma
now for treatment of asthma spray taken from the mouth is used
immediate relief is felt with use of spray taken from the mouth
because of less amount of medicine chances of adverse effect are also less
in case of children getting asthma the disease can be controlled by maintaining caution and by giving appropriate treatment
while leading normal life children can participate in all kinds of work and games
hepatitis can be more dangerous than aids
hepatitisb is common disease happening worldwide whose virus infects the liver in serious manner
virus of hepatitisb produce swelling in the liver because of which it can not function properly
this disease is even more infectious than aids because it goes very easily into body of another person via blood
just one virus of hepatitis is enough to spread this disease
other than blood it also spreads by other fluids and liquid substances coming out of body
like defecation mother milk tears drool and open wounds
by eating medicine on time and by following the advice of doctor people get better in months
the causes behind spreading of hepatitisb are the following
if blood of infected person is transfused in the body of healthy person or the shot which was given to an infected person is given to normal person then this virus goes from the infected person to the healthy person
the most important causes of hepatitis happen to be at the time of child birth from the womb of infected mothers
during this the blood which touches the body of the child the virus situated in that infected blood goes inside the child as soon as coming in contact with the blood of the child
along with india in all the countries of asia this type of infection spreads lot and new born baby gets infected from infancy itself
in the field of athletics when an infected individual gets wounded and if his blood somehow comes in contact with the blood of healthy person then it spreads very easily
it also spreads exceedingly among those who consume drugs via needle
if an applied syringe taken from an infected person is used by another person then virus goes in the healthy person
when someone in man and woman is infected with hepatitis and they have unprotected sexual intercourse then by this also the virus goes in the healthy person
the way virus of aids spreads that way virus of hepatitis also spreads
even part of blood of person infected with hepatitis is capable of spreading hepatitis
hepatitis is more dangerous than aids can be reckoned by this fact that the number of people that die because of hepatitis in day is same as the number of people that die with the infection of aids in year
in india healthy person is also infected with hepatitis
in many individuals despite being hepatitis positive they do not have the knowledge that they have hepatitis because this virus is unable to affect that individual too much
if hepatitis infects young people then get free of the disease in months only only the remaining stay infected with the disease
the main symptoms of hepatitis
in the first state of infection the person has symptoms like that of viral fever
not feeling hungry feeling nauseous getting fever these symptoms stay for days and after days eyes start becoming yellow and urine becomes yellow
which is called jaundice in common tongue
jaundice keeps increasing till to weeks
in people it gets treated in to weeks
on getting hepatitis it should be shown to gastroenterologist immediately
for treatment of hepatitis or jaundice several types of superstitions are in effect in society
therefore for its treatment one should save oneself from falling into any kind of superstition
vaccination to save liver from virus of hepatitis very effective vaccine is available
those who have been given this vaccine in them in bodies effective protective disease antibodies are produced
vaccine of hepatitis is helpful in stopping infection of jaundice
this vaccine is to be given to people thrice
in baby being born the first vaccine immediately after taking birth second after month and third after months
in adults also it is given thrice
treatment for prevention of hepatitis
in blood of person infected with hepatitis this virus stays alive for days
hence other person should not use the towel brush comb of infected person
for acupuncture everyone should use new needles
otherwise via these needles also virus of infected person will go into healthy person
razor of an infected person should not be brought in use by another person
infection can also spread by defecation of infected person
therefore healthy person should make use of toilet after complete cleaning of it or if possible another one
while having sexual intercourse infected person should surely make use of condom
if person is hepatitis positive and if all other members of his family have not been given vaccine then vaccine should be given
dissolve grams sugar in water and drink daily during meals
eat pulses lrb bowls rrb khichdi porridge rice potatoes sago porridge sweet potatoes rice puffs
eat more green leafy vegetables
take milk and fresh curd not sour curd
eat less egg fish
do not consume liqueur bidi cigarette zarda at all
precautions from hepatitis
person infected with hepatitis should absolutely keep himself from fatigue
keep oneself from too much athletics or running around
do not pick up heavy things or do not do very hard labor
do not be careless in treatment of spine tumor
in human body other body parts are attached to the spine in such way that it can move body around according to its own convenience
all daily jobs done by humans are effected by spinal cord situated in body
on this earth most developed is the very human mind which thinks for sure but it is given consequence by spinal cord only
in body role of spinal cord safe in the backbone is like an electric wire like on pressing switch bulb turns on
but electricity reaches the bulb through the wire only
just like this in getting every job finished role of spinal cord is foremost
spine happens to be the base of the whole body and rest of the bones are joined to each other like the ends of staff
back bone not being straight like staff is made of vertebrae and between every two vertebrae there is disc
at the posterior side of back bone there are many tiny joints
it is these discs and joints that impart the ability to the back bone that we can bend on all four sides
as bones of other parts of body get worn with age just like that back bone also gets worn
in many people due to the amount of water being less disc tears so there is waist pain
this pain can go from the neck towards the hand or the waist towards the foot
now treatment of tumor in spine has been considered very hard but today due to lot of techniques it has become easy
in spine tumor most common are those tumors in which cancer is in some other part of the body and tumor has occurred in the bone
in this prostrate cancer is also included
it is called metastasis
in our country most of the spine tumor patients are of this category
in spine tumor other than backache there is danger of paralysis in legs due to pressure on nerves
other than tumor of spine there can be tumor in spinal cord
the unique thing about this tumor is that it can occur at any age
in treatment of this other than removing the bone as soon as treatment from chemotherapy and radiotherapy is possible it is good
because at later stage patient does not get any benefit from it
treatment of spinal cord is only surgery
the direct relation of back ache is with back bone
according to spine society of india to crore people above years of age are patients of backache
to escape from backache however modern technique of operation is available in country but there is no better treatment than precaution
in our spine between every two vertebra there is thin flexible membrane or cushion which is called an intervertebra disc
by this flexibility comes in spine and it works like spring
many times due to imbalance in muscles else by suddenly picking up weight or by suddenly bending the body the part in the inner side of the intervertebral disc which is very soft by shifting comes towards the hole between two vertebrae
by this pressure is exerted on the nerves there and pain is felt anywhere from waist to leg
tingling and weakness is felt in legs
nowadays for treatment of slip disc surgery like spinal endoscopy has become possible
firstly it is important to know what is the cause behind slip disc
if by working too much backache or waist pain is occurring then it will get better by resting
do not keep body in tension
do not pick up too much weight prevent constipation
develop habit of exercise from start climbing stairs and strolling at brisk pace is good exercise
do not just work also take rest
keep your sitting posture right take balanced diet
in meals include vegetables with calcium
take green vegetables and vitamin
diseases of thoracic spine and vat surgery
nowadays due to increasing use of computer eruption of pain in neck is increasing fast
in big cities of india and in metropolitan cities in the face of increasing use of computer there is rapid increase in number of people afflicted with waist pain
from children to aged everyone can be affected by waist pain
increasing age heavy physical work people working in the same condition for long time lrb like secretary receptionist workers of call center rrb people who pick up heavy loads get affected more
if it is the case of it treatment then several kinds of treatments are also present
bed rest injection surgical treatment spinal fusion disc transplant vertebroplasty pinhole surgery and minimum invasive surgery etc
now the beginning of new surgery has been done and it is vat surgery lrb video assisted thoracoscopy rrb
today diseases related to backbone have increased lot
till now surgery of thoracoscopic spine lrb which happens to be behind the chest rrb is very difficult and excruciating
for this the surgery was possible only by cutting the ribs and by removing the heart and lungs to one side the side effects of which used to be very serious
but now by vat surgery it has become possible to treat these diseases very easily by cutting and ripping
what are the common diseases of thoracic spine
in thoracic spine like neck and waist all diseases are possible like slip disc tumor infection like fracture hunchback etc
in diseases of thoracic spine behind the chest there is pain in waist and tension in chest
this pain can sometimes go down to the legs
with this it can produce numbness in legs difficulty in walking and in daily activities
the cause behind all these difficulties is pressure on nerves
now this pressure can be easily reduced via vat surgery
by this the distortion of waist in patients of hunchback can be removed easily
the benefits of vat surgery
in vat surgery all those surgeries are possible through thin telescope by reaching the backbone while watching on tv screen which were possible before on cutting open the chest
the whole vat surgery gets over in only hours
the main advantage of vat is that patient can start walking around from next day there is no risk of bleeding or infection and patient gets discharge from the hospital in days
with this for patients of hunchback deformation of waist can be easily reduced
cancer of gall bladder can be fatal
in cancer of gall bladder there is no pain from the start
gall bladder closes because of cancer
because of which jaundice can happen to the patient in the last stage of his life
gall bladder can be removed by inserting stunt in the infected part present in the gall bladder of patient of cancer
so that the patient does not face much trouble in last stage
it would be better that the patient is admitted to such hospital where there are better stomach disease experts so that the anguish of patient is reduced at the end of his life
cancer of gall bladder on increasing spreads even to the lymph node of stomach then this is also not possible that it be cut and removed from body via surgery
cancer spreading to the lymph node means that the chances of the patient recovering fully becomes
why do lymph nodes enlarge in stomach
ordinarily lymph nodes are found in the stomach of all individuals but when they increase inside the stomach then there are many reasons behind their enlargement
these lymph nodes of stomach enlarge due to disease also
their own cancer in lymph nodes which is called lymphoma because of that also they can enlarge
other than lymph node one more cancer is also there which is called hodgkin disease or in some other part of body if cancer is occurring then lymph nodes enlarge in the stomach
cancer of stomach and cancer of gall bladder mostly spread in the lymph nodes of stomach only
if in the gall bladder there is some ordinary common defect then it is removed out of the body
patient can lead normal life but if cancer is in its first stage
if cancer on increasing reaches the lymph nodes then it is late stage of cancer and in this attempts can also be made to save the patient
cancer is surely horrible disease but if detected in time then this disease can be cured too
therefore after years years and years of age every person should certainly get medical examination of all his body parts done once

between auricles and ventricles special valves have been made which in reality do the work of gatekeeper
the valve of the left side is called mitral and valve of right side is called tricuspid
from these blood can go from auricle to ventricle only and can not come back up because by then they are closed
this way at the meeting point of ventricles and main bloodcarriers also these valves of the shape of half moon give permission to blood to circulate in the whole body through the medium of the main bloodcarriers
blood is not able to return back into the heart because by that time these valves shut
after all what is the necessity of blood circulation every moment
medical literature says that by complete blood circulation cc oxygen is received by every cell that is successful in giving only minutes of life to them hence it is necessary for blood circulation to get activated again
the blood carriers that take pure blood to all cells are called arteries

fever occurring on getting sore throat damages heart and its valves forever
pain in joints increase in weight slight fever persistently phlegmatic throat lessening appetite bleeding from nose etc are its main source of identification

due to which the heart has to put in more pressure for blood circulation because the pathway of blood circulation becomes narrow

main symptoms of jaundice
in jaundice substance named bilirubin becomes more than normal
as consequence of which in the gaps of skin nails urine and mouth yellowness is seen
bilirubin named colored substance is made in our body absolutely everyday
the root source of generation of bilirubin are red molecules of blood
the life of red molecules of blood has been considered as about days
they get destroyed after days
on getting destroyed substance named bilirubin is born out of them
bilirubin keeps going round in our body through the course of blood
through the course of blood bilirubin reaches our liver
in the liver bit of bilirubin gets destroyed and some part through the bile juice after reaching small intestine gets mixed with faeces and gives faeces its own color
this is the very reason that the colors of faeces are various
if there comes an obstruction in the bile duct that makes bilirubin reach the intestine from the liver then this substance does not reach the intestine
as result color of faeces becomes white
faeces becoming white is considered the main symptom of jaundice
in this way some amount of bilirubin while coming out through urine makes urine like itself
all these are normal processes which happen in our body absolutely everyday
as result of defect in liver the cycle of bilirubin gets disturbed
consequently the amount of bilirubin in blood increases which gets accumulated in body parts like eyes skin and nails etc this way these body parts start looking yellow and weakness in body increases

dr minocha of batra hospital has to say that actually our skin has three layers epidermis dermis and subcutaneous
the outermost layer which is visible to us it is called epidermis
the middle layer is called dermis and the innermost layer is called epidermis
dermis has flexibility and the protein and moisture in it helps in preventing wrinkles
with advancement in age the flexibility and moisture in dermis starts reducing by which the layer becomes thin and is not able to send moisture to the outer layer
the result of which are wrinkles
according to beauty expert arti sharma after the age of years women should be cautions towards wrinkles
if from beginning some things are kept in mind then for many years wrinkles can be averted
in order to stay protected against wrinkles do not stay in direct light of sun for very long
especially the ultra violet rays of the sun from clock in the morning till evening become the biggest cause of wrinkles
while going out in sun swimming or in the field of sports make use of sun protection cream
abstain from smoking
smoking absorbs the precious moisture of skin because of which wrinkles form before time
daily massage your skin with hydrating cream or moisturiser especially when the air is dry
by applying excessive cream on face the pores get closed because of which the sweat does not come out profusely and becomes the reason for prickly heat and wrinkles
if yoga is done then one can stay safe from wrinkles for quite long time
if with other precautions you practice yoga then till years of age the wrinkles will not appear
keep in mind that for oily dry fine sensitive skins etc the lotions are also of different types
use lotion only after taking advice from the specialist

india was the first country in which the national program for blindness prevention was started in after detecting the comprehensiveness of the deficiency of vitamin
short term and long term solutions have been included in this national program
the plan for long term solutions have been made for making vitamin rich food materials abundant and to encourage their food
on the other hand in order to prevent blindness and to avoid the other ill effects of deficiency of vitamin the heavy dose of vitamin to children from months to years is short term solution
national nutrition organisation hyderabad reviewed this national program in
in order to achieve the desired result from the program it has been found that it is important to make the related health workers and those running the program more aware together with the immense cooperation of people of the community
the department of health and family welfare formed task force in to prepare the principles to rectify the execution of the vitamin program and to clarify the ways of the work
under this effort booklet has been prepared for the health workers and those who are running the program
in the program of national prevention of disease against the blindness occurring due to deficiency of vitamin it is important to make the working staff of program more aware together with immense cooperation of the people of the community
the problem of the deficiency of vitamin
in the developing countries the deficiency of vitamin has been identified as chief problem occurring due to the deficiency of nutrition and control over it can be achieved
the role of vitamin in the prevention of blindness due to lack of nutrition is very well known
according to vague estimation the eye sight of around thousand children may be lost due to deficiency of vitamin
by getting vitamin in huge quantity blindness occurring due to lack of nutrition can be prevented
vitamin has very huge hand in correcting the health of children and reducing their mortality rate
till now there is no clear knowledge as to how vitamin does such vital works
it has been noticed in indonesia that the children in whom there is deficiency of vitamin in them the danger of onset of dysentery and the grave type of infection related to respiration increases by to times
death of around percent children in india is due to dysentery and the diseases related to respiratory diseases
because of measles the quantity of accumulated vitamin in the body decreases
because of the heavy fall in quantity of vitamin the danger of chances of other diseases increase
these diseases are pneumonia onset of dysentery and dry eye discharge lrb xerophthalmia rrb
every year thousands of children die due to measles and other complications occurring because of it
apart from this the cornea of the eye is damaged due to this and the child may also become blind
the deficiency of vitamin why and how
the deficiency of vitamin gives rise to xerophthalmia that is the disease of dry eye discharge lrb the drying up of eye rrb
in xerophthalmia the outermost layer of the pupil that is conjunctiva and after that the layer below the conjunctiva cornea dries up
due to the damage of cornea after this the eye sight is lost
when the accumulated vitamin in body finishes and the quantity of vitamin received by body through daily food is less than required then xerophthalmia occurs
xerophthalmia occurs due to these reasons
xerophthalmia occurs due to the reduced consumption of less food rich in vitamin everyday
xerophthalmia occurs due to the error in transmission of the absorbed retinol to the right place in the body and the fast depletion of the accumulated vitamin in the body
the deficiency of food materials rich in vitamin the reduction of the quantity of vitamin accumulated in the body are the chief causes of xerophthalmia
the absorption of vitamin in the children victims of dysentery respiration related infections measles diseases of stomach and intestines decreases and its need to the body increases
as result of this cabal of infections starts
because of the deficiency of vitamin the power of the body to fight with the infections is reduced
due to infection the health of the child goes on deteriorating
eye related signals and symptoms
although the deficiency of vitamin affects many organs but its worst effect is seen on the eyes because of which eye sight is constantly lost
the surface of the cornea becomes dry and rough which later on ruptures partially or completely
wound develops because of this in the cornea
the damage to eyes is such due to the wound in the cornea that it is permanent that is it can never become alright
the eye sight goes by this
eye related symptoms are the most trustworthy measure to identify the deficiency of vitamin
in the serious condition of disease the grave symptoms may become visible early
it is not essential that mild symptoms before order and grave symptoms later on are visible
the detection of the signs and symptoms of xerophthalmia
night blindness the first symptom of xerophthalmia
in night blindness the child can not see after darkness or things kept near him in the room
bitata stains although there could be difference in the shape place and design of the bitata stains but they are similar in appearance
bitata stains are formed due to the accumulation of frothy substance on conjunctiva
if disease of keratomalacia is not treated then cornea at the place of wound may get permanently damaged
due to keratomalacia hole may occur in the cornea
in the condition of hole in cornea the damage would never be corrected
the sooner the treatment of keratomalacia is done the smaller would be the wound and the damage of cornea
if the treatment is done fast then the damage of the cornea and the blindness occurring due to it can be completely prevented
india was the first country which had implemented national level program to prevent blindness occurring in children of less than years due to the deficiency of vitamin
in order to prevent blindness occurring due to deficiency of vitamin national disease prevention program was started in

the danger of blindness due to the deficiency of vitamin is the maximum in the children less than five years of age
at first the age of pre school children lrb to years rrb was included in this program
now by giving an extension to this program children of months are also being included
together with this there is the proposal to give priority to children from months to years
giving extra dose of vitamin in addition from time to time is effective and safe
on giving the dose of vitamin in limited quantity its ill effects are negligible
at times the effects of headache and vomiting are seen but they are seldom and common
the prevention of blindness occurring due to deficiency of vitamin
the decided dose of vitamin is as follows
children of months giving the dose
the time of the inoculation of measles is good time to give the dose of vitamin
children of years the dose of iu every months
the treatment of children affected with the deficiency of vitamin
on the identification of deficiency of vitamin all children affected with this must be immediately given the dose of iu of vitamin
one to four weeks after this second dose of of vitamin should be given
in order to avoid the occurrence of the deficiency of vitamin again the regular intake of vitamin rich food items like green leafy vegetables and fruits and vegetables of yellow pulp should be encouraged
children who are suffering from dysentery intense respiratory infection an eye must be kept carefully on them
such children must be administered the normal dose of vitamin
for the national program the solution of vitamin comes in the form of fragrant syrup in bottle of millilitre
the quantity of vitamin in syrup is per millilitre
with each bottle there is also spoon of ml measurement with it
by consuming the syrup by filling up to the mark on spoon the determined quantity of iu of vitamin is obtained
in order to keep vitamin there is no need of any special type of arrangement like the cold series
then also vitamin should be kept in dark and cold room protected from sunlight
after opening the bottle all its solution must be used within weeks
on not opening the bottle the solution of vitamin in the bottle stays safe when kept in dark and cold place for around one year
the cost of ml of the bottle of the syrup is around rupees or the cost of one dose of iu of vitamin is around paise
the solution of vitamin is given free to the community through the medium of primary health center

by cutting one end of the capsule with scissors or clean blade all the content filled in it must be squeezed in the mouth of the infant baby
vitamin syrup is obtained from the ministry of health and family welfare
on the basis of the probable number of the beneficiaries lrb the children from months to years of age rrb the medical officer of the primary health center should put demand for the required quantity of vitamin
the maternal and child health department of health and family welfare department is that central department which has the complete responsibility of the implementation of program
the program is implemented by the primary health center and sub center in the rural areas under the guidance of medical officers
the medical officer of the primary health center is in charge of getting vitamin administering dose of vitamin to children and guiding the program

the contact happening with the newborn babies of months for the inoculation of measles is the best time for giving the first dose of vitamin lrb iu rrb
intensive children development service lrb icds rrb program provides opportunity to give vitamin to children of months to years of age
not only should aanganbari workers help in identifying needy children but they should also help in administering vitamin dose and health education to areas where icds program is running

in order to keep track of the vitamin dose being given to the children of less than two years the motherchild security card should be brought into use
under the icds program vigilance is kept on all the children of up to years so that the use of their growth vigilance card is behavioural
lack of vitamin in food and lack of accumulated vitamin in the body are chief reasons of xerophthalmia
in children of pre school age lack of vitamin and carotene lrb the initial form of vitamin rrb in the daily diet is the chief reason of tension

after cooking this much of vegetable is reduced to only two tablespoonful
along with the other food items child can eat this much of vegetable easily
this way he can easily fulfil his daily need of vitamin
the inclusion of other food items rich in vitamin apart from green leafy vegetables like dairy products lrb milk cheese curd butter rrb liver eggs ghee and oil should also be encouraged
such habits related to diet put stop on the lack of vitamin
the consumption of green leafy vegetables and other food items rich with vitamin everyday during pregnancy and breast feeding is advised
because of the state of vitamin in the body of the mother the quantity of vitamin in the mother milk and by that the health of the child is affected

how can the diagnosis and treatment of cancer be done
many times due to less information or carelessness the diagnosis of breast cancer is done late
if you stay little attentive then the treatment of breast cancer is possible timely
be cautious towards your body and get investigated by the doctor from time to time then riddance from breast cancer can be obtained easily
if tumor is felt in breasts together with growth in the arm pits then be cautious
mild pain and swelling is felt on that place because of the growth of tumor
change comes in the breasts or their size
at times wound appears on the place of swelling and then blood secretion starts from there
when the tumor is on the upper and outer surface of the breast and there is secretion from the breast then immediately contact the doctor in such situation
the tumor appears hard and there is no pain in it on touching
the women who are more than thirty years of age should certainly themselves inspect their breasts once monthly seven days after the menstruation
the stages of breast cancer are believed to be four
but as the spreading of the wound increases its treatment becomes difficult
in the fourth stage also if its treatment is done then success is achieved in percent cases
in the first and second stage the treatment is cent percent possible
in the first stage the size of the tumor is less than two centimetres
the tumor of two centimetres is not visible in any part of theory
in the second stage the tumor grows to two to five centimetres big
this reaches to the neighbouring gland of colourless fluid
in the third stage the tumor grows to five cm and spreads to the skin and muscles of the body but does not reach up to the neighbouring gland
in the fourth and very dangerous stage the tumor can be of any size
the tumors do get affected by this and it also spreads to the other parts of the body
as first surgery is done on the area with pain and then it is diagnosed that how big is the spread
the conclusion may be wrong at the clinical stage but at the surgical stage the condition becomes very clear
after the age of forty years the women should certainly get the mammography done
in one mammography the expenditure comes to one thousand rupees
do not hesitate at all in getting mammography done
discuss about this tell this to the members of the family and accumulate new information
the treatment of breast cancer is expensive which comes to one lac rupees
but many charitable institutes are such which help immensely in this to the person
many help line services are also available for the treatment of breast cancer
the treatment of cancer depends upon the age of the patient the shape and spreading of the tumor formed in the breast
maximum women have to undergo surgery following which they are advised for anti cancer drug or hormone therapy
some women are advised for radiotherapy after the surgery so that the cancer is eliminated from the roots
after the age of forty get mammogram done regularly or else do the inspection of your breast yourself after consulting the doctor
if there is any type of tumor in the breast then immediately contact the doctor
all the tumors are not cancerous but showing precaution is important
if there is discharge of blood from the breast then immediately show to the doctor
in the grown situation of the cancer the breast has to be removed partially or completely
at present in place of the severed breast fake breast can be implanted through surgery
the creation of breast is done with the tissues of the muscles of the patients only
since breast cancer is also dependent on the quantity of hormone in the blood therefore the chances of cancer decreases on removing the uterus
whoever has got breast cancer once should not conceive in future because by this there is chance of breast cancer to start again
in order to be safe from breast cancer it is important to bring change in ones food habits and physical and mental behavior as well
get your breasts checked up once in month
the benefit of this is that if you are suspicious then in the first stage only you will get to know about that and you will be saved from the danger forever
start the test seven days after the menstruation
toothache should not take away sleep
the health of your entire body and beauty is connected with the health of teeth
the aching of teeth is actually such pain which if happens to anybody then his sleep at night and the peace of daytime is lost
if you want to escape from toothache then do not show even slight carelessness in the care of teeth
although everyone know this that teeth are the very important part of the human body but still it has been seen that there are less than of the people who get the regular checkups of their teeth done
percent of the children in our country don not get any type of dental care
the effort should be this that cleaning teeth should be included in the habit of the child and later on it should not have any difficulty
when the teeth of the children start coming out then it is required to keep special eye on them and to keep more information about teeth
often it has been seen that in this phase the children suck their thumb bit more
actually they get relief by sucking their thumb
if this habit of sucking thumb does not get over even by the age of fourfive years then the case becomes serious
the thumb starts weakening and it also has bad effect on the teeth as well
in such case many times to give correct shape to the teeth many times the braces are needed
it should not be such that in order to stop the thumb you give nipple to the child that also the honey one
this will be even worse with him
when the children of to months start walking then they also fall down several times
due to the falling of the children they also have to become victims of the injuries
to whatever extent it is possible save the children from falling
in mild injuries the need to visit the doctor does not arise
if the gums of the children get injured badly then you must take it to the dentist
how should be the food of the children
the children should be given such snacks in which there is no excessive sugar and they are non sticky
the parts of sticky food items like lollypop toffee etc get stuck to the gums and teeth of the children
at this time everyone ignores this in laugh that the children do eat all these things and there is no effect but later on this is included in their habit whose maximum fine is borne by their teeth
the mouth of children is filled by innumerable bacteria
whenever the children eat sweets these bacteria also feed on them and in return release acid
on an average the teeth start coming out in the age of six months
during the six months when the teeth start becoming visible clean them with wet clean clothes
on becoming two years old start his brushing
do not give paste to the children before the age of seven years because their teeth need fluoride after seven years only
yes if you have to give the temptation of paste then put negligible paste on the toothbrush
no matter how much the child protests certainly clean his teeth
if the bacteria start getting accumulated in teeth then getting rid of them would become difficult
the biggest reason of the falling of teeth are these bacteria
due to the reason of bacteria the teeth of children fall rapidly in comparison to the elders
to the children give the brush of their choice
by doing such the children will show interest in brushing
try that the children should do the brushing with their own hands
by cleaning your teeth you show to them that in what manner they should do the brushing
you will be surprised to know that every year the teeth of thousands of children fall untimely the chief reason of which is milk and the products made from milk
not wiping their mouth not rinsing their mouth after making them eat something may become lesson of problem for them in future
many motherfather feed milk to children when they are sleeping and the bottle stays stuck to their lips for hours which in no way is good situation
this milk provides nutrition for long to the bacteria whose result are the cavities
later on what could be the situation of the teeth of these children this can easily be imagined
give good toothpaste to the children
give only those toothpastes to children which are specially created by keeping their age in mind
the brush should also be of good quality and its bristles should also be soft
save the children from any type of injury
the teeth of children are extremely weak and there is also big danger of their breaking on falling
take utmost care of baby teeth especially
often motherfather have the belief that the baby teeth have to go even if they break untimely then also there is no effect while this is not so
these teeth give good look to the face and also give support to the gums and the teeth which would come out later on
the new coming teeth take their place in the right manner but if these teeth break untimely then the teeth which come out later on do not get good shape
keep the emergency number of the dentist written in the mobile and diary no one knows when its need arises
if the tooth gets broken suddenly on getting hit then go to the doctor immediately
if the treatment of this broken tooth is done in an hour then the chances of its getting fixed again increases
otherwise many times the situation can be such that the tooth does not grow out again
fake tooth may be required to be put in future
if the teeth of the children are paining in eating or drinking something then also take it to the doctor
if the toothache is not treated in time then its ill effects can be on the nearby teeth and gums
the dentist does its root canal by which the teeth are saved
the part of teeth which is empty the dentist does its crowning
through the intraoral camera the dentist makes the patient familiar with all the activities inside his mouth
this magnifies the mouth by times and all the scenes within start moving in front of the eyes like film
the fiber optical headlight instrument which pierces the darkness of the mouth make she eyes of the dentist reach the inner parts mouth and gums
again then no disease stays hidden from him
you must have often seen that doctors put something like spectacles on their eyes
actually this is the surgical telescope by which the minute things of teeth and gums can be seen
to investigate the mouth minutely digital xray proves to be of very high use
these new digital ray machines consist of to percent less radiation in comparison to the old xray machines
the best thing of digital xray is that by this the very big image comes in front of the patient only that the dentist can discuss with him about every part of the mouth

if you regularly take care of the teeth at home then it will give you company for the entire lifetime
to maintain the whiteness of the teeth is no difficult task
you have to do only this that you should regularly consume asafoetida and strawberry
today an interesting thing has come into vogue it is this that in order to save the patient from the boredom after sitting in the dental chair music systems of various types have been put in several dental clinics
the patient puts earphones and gets drowned in good music then what does he care the treatment of teeth goes on and he stays carefree
if the treatment of teeth is not done on time then many diseases can surround you you can even get cancer
the infection of gums can also be lethal at times
because of rotten gums tonsil infection in the bones and the entire body due to the transmission of blood can be negatively affected
that is if you are really worried about health then do not show any careless with regards to the care of the teeth
when should you go to the dentist
if you go to the dentist after every six months then the disease can never come anywhere near the teeth
if your gums are bleeding the taste of the mouth becomes foul if there is any disease related to mouth and teeth then certainly remember the dentist
if you smoke then you must certainly be needing the dentist because smoking has very bad effect on the gums they become black and week
if someone smokes in the house then remind him of the slogan of quit smoking
if care lessens has not been shown in the cleanliness of the teeth then there is no need to worry
the way in which cleanliness is required for each organ of our body in the same way the teeth also need
if the teeth give you problem then you entire body will cry out

as much as possible bring in use the brush of soft bristles
change your toothbrush in every twothree months
because first the torn bristles may harm your teeth and gums and secondly bacteria start growing in them
if you have cold then it would be good if you change your brush
your brush should be small
keep the bristles at the angle of degree angle on the teeth
make the brush move in circular manner on gums and teeth
with the help of the brush clean the teeth both inside and outside
clean your tongue also at the time of brushing because bacteria are also accumulated on the tongue which produce odour on getting stuck
certainly brush twice daily
one should definitely brush for three minutes but keep in mind that excess pressure should not be exerted on the teeth
massage the gums with finger intermittently
if brushing after breakfast is included in the routine then it would be the icing on the cake and one will also be free for the day
keep wet clean handkerchief close by before feeding milk to the child
clean the gums and mouth very softly immediately after feeding milk to the child
never let the child go to sleep with the bottle of milk or juice in mouth
the juice of fruits has natural sugar while the sugar contained in milk is called lactose
if the lactose is left stuck to the tooth then it will inspire the bacteria to release lethal acid
if the permanent tooth of the child falls after getting broken
pick the tooth and wash it properly with clean water
now wet the tooth in glass of milk
but one thing you should always keep in mind do not touch the root of the tooth
within six hours get this tooth fixed at its right place
get rid of the odour of the mouth

finely grind the dried peels of oranges
the powder of the dried peels of orange will make you teeth shine on one hand it will also remove the odour of the mouth
if the teeth are not shining then the attraction of the face remains incomplete
there was time when the braces of jassi had become very famous but by god today what can be said about her beauty
today the women have become some more beauty conscious
if the teeth are in bad shape then reduction comes in the beauty of the face in such case dentists are the ones who make the face beautiful by giving good shape to the teeth
implantologist and orthodontist play the chief role in this
implant is the latest technology in india
generally before implanting tooth the nearby good teeth are rubbed and then new tooth is fixed
in the use of the technique named implant there is no need to fiddle with the nearby teeth
screw is fitted in the implant affected part and it is left to heal for four to six months
after this pure titanium tooth is implanted over it which looks very real
though implant is very costly treatment and the cost of one tooth implant comes to to thousand but despite it this technique is liked very much today
this also has two reasons one they look real and beautiful and second they become your own forever
orthodontist is one such specialist which treats various types of distorted teeth with braces
that is by bringing right shape to the teeth it makes our face beautiful
the beauty of white and shining teeth is simply outstanding
the teeth become yellow when the protein and bacteria get stuck on the teeth after getting mixed

some myths which disturb
the eyesight becomes weak on the removal of the upper tooth this myth is totally false
removal of tooth has got nothing to do with sight
when the artificial set of teeth or denture is built for once then it comes to use for the entire lifetime
but it is not at all like that the tissues below the denture keep engine with time and the dentures do not fit and such dentures then do not stay hygienic therefore the dentist advice to change it every five years
if the treatment of damaged tooth is done once then all the problems of teeth and gums get over but it is not like that
different yes of materials are used to correct the teeth and change comes in this material as well
if the cleaning of that part is not done well then there stays suspicion of rottenness within it
also the inspection of that corrected tooth once in year is essential
there are many types of disbeliefs regarding the health of the teeth
are you also not victim of any misbelieve
scaling weakens the teeth this is also wrong belief
actually the teeth become weak only when the gums and teeth are not cleaned properly
if the scaling of the teeth is not done regularly then the gums become weak and the teeth start falling after getting rotten
the procedure for the treatment of teeth is painful it is not at all like that
the patient is given local anaesthesia due to which no matter what kind of treatment is done to the teeth there is no feeling of pain
very modern high drilling machines also do not vibrate much
the pregnant women should not get the treatment of the teeth done this myth is also baseless
get the treatment of teeth done as per your wish but yes it is important that you certainly take the permission of the doctor before surgical treatment
if the xray is not done in the initial three months of pregnancy then it would be good
the teeth should be massaged with finger and not brush this is also false belief
brush having good bristles removes the food particles entangled in the teeth properly
massaging the gums with finger after cleaning the teeth with brush is beneficial
it is not good to clean teeth with rice salt and tobacco powder etc
while the truth is that in good quality pastes there are such particles which are specially mixed for the teeth
the loather formed out of paste destroys the bacteria on the teeth while because of these things the upper layer of the teeth becomes bad and the dirt on the teeth is also not removed
the specialisation of the prosthodontist dentist is in making dentures
prosthodontist replaces those teeth which have broken because is some accident or the weakening of the gums or old age

many interesting facts are connected to the teeth
teeth is the most hard and strong part of our body
daily eat and drink such food by which the health of the teeth is maintained
healthy food and drinks are fast friends of teeth
there is plenty of calcium in dairy products like milk cheese and curd which make the teeth strong and healthy
if the dairy products are not more then include those food items in your food in which there is good quantity of calcium
in between meals do not take much snacks especially those in which there is more sugar and sourness
in this plaque develops in the teeth and gradually they come in the condition of failing after getting weakened
drink enough water especially the water of the tap because it has fluoride which strengthens the gums
take those medicines and syrups which are sugar free
the health is also maintained only when extremely pure and clean water is available
many times despite knowing that the water coming out of the tap is dirty we do not take any measure from our side to clean it
many times due to polluted water several types of dangerous diseases surround the person like typhoid cholera paratyphoid fever jaundice polio disease etc
the diseases of stagnant water like malaria and dengue are even more dangerous diseases

nurturing child is not joke attention must be kept on him every time
every moment an eye must be kept on the development of the child

what is conception
when the sperms of man meet with the ovum of woman then conception takes place
but before this conception many situations are formed
firstly the sperms reach the uterus by going through the vaginal canal and enter the fallopian tube
here in the broad portion of the tube there is mating with the developed eggs which comes out of the ovary
on entering the eggs sperms mix their chromosomes with the egg
the egg gets fertilized and after developing gets converted into multicelled ball which is called blastocyst
this gets attached to the surface of the uterus
the contact with the muscles of the tube and the cilia lining as thin as hair advance the egg towards uterus
the egg does not advance on its own
every month many eggs are developed but in hair follicle only one egg is able to develop
the other eggs get squeezed on their own
lakhs of sperms enter the uterus but maximum get destroyed due to the reason of the acidic substances inside
one or two out of whatever sperms escape get attached to the outer layer of the egg and the moment conception takes place it puts ban on the entry of other sperms
following situations come in conception
sperms passes through the uterus and goes to the fallopian tube
the egg enters the tube
the sperm makes the egg conceive
the zygote gets divided into two
cells of zygote enter inside the uterus
this gets converted into seed
on reaching its destination the seed gets connected with the surface of the uterus
here it gets nutritive substances from the blood cells of the mother
related to the menstrual cycle generally women have this misbelief that it is dirty blood and the more it flows out of the body the better it is
but this is very wrong misbelief
actually the reason of menstruation is the destruction of inner wall of skin inside the uterus that is the endometruim line
the thinner this wall would be that much less would be the flow of blood
because of excess flow there is deficiency of iron elements in the body of the woman and the woman becomes victim of anemia
actually menstrual cycle is one such physical change in the body of women which comes entirely within the system of reproduction and is very important for reproduction
the menstruation coming every month is the time between the onset of puberty and menarche
during the menstrual cycle from the body of fully mature woman during ovulation ovum is released with this the lining of uterus endometrium develops that time only
after ovulation this lining prepares the reproduced egg and conception takes place
if conception does not take place then new menstrual cycle starts
this is the part of the endometrium and blood products which comes through the passage of vagina
generally the menstrual cycle is of days
it has three phases in first phase menstruation lrb from up to days rrb
in the second phase the hormone cycle lrb from up to days rrb
the third phase suitable for reproduction lrb to rrb
before the start of menstruation many changes in the hormones take place whose maximum effect is seen on the behavior of the women like the increase of irritation some stiffness in breast increase of weight swelling etc
because of the reason of the bursting of ovarian cyst many times there is sudden pain in abdomen
many times blood also starts flowing heavily the reason of occurrence of both these complications together is soreness in genitals
but there is no need to panic in this because these diseases become alright easily by proper treatment
generally there is misbelief that four days prior to menstruation four days of menstruation and four days after menstruation are very safe but this is possible only when your menstruation is regular
the second method is that everyday the woman takes her temperature and notes that in diary
the day on which temperature rises by one degree then believe that egg has been produced this day
five days before and after this day are said to be unsafe
by recording the temperature for three four months the woman can easily get to know her unsafe days easily
various methods are present for contraception you have to choose according to your ease
because of not using the methods of contraception children are born one after the other and by becoming victim of malnutrition go to the embraces of death
in the entire world death of around thousand children takes place out of this percent deaths occur only in developing countries
the mother and child should stay healthy and fit and proper gap should be there between two children for all these it is important that methods of contraception should be used
for men condom is very cheap and is simple option and it also saves them from many infections
there should be knowledge of the method of its proper use
apart from this because of this the woman has to depend completely on the man
after discharging instead of putting the semen in the woman vagina he throws it outside
though it is good and free of cost option but because of this the danger of conception is maintained without interruption
in the process of vasectomy also that passage is closed without incision through which the sperms flow
what is to be understood is that only the passage is closed
this is small work of minutes
by coming on his own the person can go back home on his own
after vasectomy he can do his daily work as usual
in vasectomy one precaution has to be taken for the next three months while doing intercourse condom has to be used
after vasectomy on the interval of one month and then in the third month coming for the doctoral test is important and after the doctoral report intercourse can be done without any tension without any condom
but for this men do not agree easily
the options for contraception for women
women can use pills cream jelly sponge etc which are put in the genitals so that semen can not go inside
the pills are put some minutes before intercourse or on need may be put one hour before
during six hours if intercourse is done again then it is important to put the tablet again in the genital
copper is good option these are of several types
copper this may be put for three years
copper this may be put for ten years
multiload copper and this may be put for five years
by this technique semen may be stopped from coming inside
but get the copper fixed only when there is no pregnancy
as menstruation starts or as it ends you may get it fixed
after getting the copper fixed there is no need to use any other contraceptive option at all
after getting the copper fixed get the doctoral check up done certainly in the interval of one month and then three months and then every six months
in market some emergency contraceptive pills are available
these are such pills which are taken in emergency that is then when conception takes place by mistake
these should be taken between hours of conception
after this take five days morning evening
taking two pills immediately during conception morning evening and two pills hours after pregnancy the risk of pregnancy is averted
when the family is completely planned then through surgery also women may get rid of pregnancy forever
this is done in two ways first through telescope and second by cutting the stomach slightly
by telescope the fallopian tube is either tied or destroyed
by incising the stomach also this process may be done
both these processes are painless and hundred percent successful contraceptives
at our place since long intercourse is done by calculating the days which is considered successful contraceptive option to great extent
apart from this regular and uninterrupted breast feeding is also considered to be good contraceptive
in today modern world though there are options one after the other like condom pills which are kept in the genitals copper etc but the most effective options are contraceptive pills
contraceptive pills are those pills which are eaten which women find the most comforting
in modern times karl deresy is considered to be the genitor of contraceptive pills
these pills on going to the body of the female stop the female from conceiving
because of pills no new eggs are formed in the body of the female
in the contraceptive pills of yesteryears the quantity of estrogen and progesterone used to be very high which had several ill effects
but in modern pills there is no such danger
these pills provide cent percent protection to the woman
by this the menstrual cycle becomes regular
the pain and blood flow occurring these days also reduces by which the complaint of anemia does not occur
apart from this protection from the tumor of the breast etc also takes place
in some sort of reduction in the level of hormone had been brought
after this its as if the standard of contraceptive pills have started improving
today these pills have only been considered to be the best contraceptives
some times back from now there used to be days and days course of contraceptive pills
for days one pill only had to be taken daily according to fixed time
now the pill to be taken once week has also come
these contraceptive pills are easily available in the market which may be bought from any chemist
these pills may be bought from any medical store
related information is attached with these contraceptive pills
obesity does not only make the personality unattractive it even attracts many diseases
how should be the lifestyle for staying fit
no one wants that there should be useless fat on his body but due to carelessness in lifestyle weight starts increasing and many types of diseases start surrounding
today piling up of fat on body is universal problem
it should in fact be said that in case of obesity india is slowly on path of america
here obesity is given the status of disease
here every third person is victim of obesity
if said in the language of the doctors then any person becomes obese when in comparison to the calorie used by him he consumes calorie in more quantity through the medium of food and other food materials
this imbalance in the consumed and used calorie may arise due to various reasons
now this depends on the particular person that which reason is responsible for him becoming fat
obesity may also happen due to hereditary reasons
although this is also fact that the food habits and life style of some families are the ones which increase obesity
but despite this it has been proved in researches that somewhere the biological makeup of human body is also responsible for obesity
especially for adopted children it has already been proved that there is much closeness in their weight and the weight of their real parents in comparison to the weight of their adopted parents
environmental reasons also become cause for obesity
in this the lifestyle and food related habits are included
what any person eats and how much he is involved in physical activity it has direct relation with his health especially the weight of the body
if he does not burn the calorie received through food then extra calorie starts accumulating in his body in the form of fat
and lastly the result is the person becoming victim of obesity
today people eat lot of fast food and fried things but save their skin from labor
at homes modern instruments are present for the help of women then children keep sitting in front of tv computer for hours
not only this their mouth is always full with chips chocolates and other market things
on the other hand seven eight hours of day of office going women men are spent sitting on the chair
what is meant by saying is that the opportunities for man to be included in physical activities are becoming less and less and the consequences are in front
even the smell of food makes the person obese
many times even when there is no hunger he comes towards the food attracted with the smell and in return he gets more calorie than the required
psychological reasons also become the cause of obesity
on being mentally unhealthy also there is tendency of man to eat more
especially on being victim of tension sadness anger or inferiority complex not only do the people eat more but at regular intervals they also get the urge to eat something or the other
this way they not only receive calorie in high quantity but by repeated eating the eaten food also does not get digested and the rate of their digestion lrb the rate of the consumption of energy rrb becomes disrupted
in such situation it becomes difficult task for them to get rid of obesity
but it is seen up to the extent that the enthusiasm towards life in the person disturbed mentally diminishes
and in such situation he becomes depressed towards keeping himself fit or to reduce obesity
the diseases occurring due to obesity
heart attack sugar lrb type rrb stone in gall bladder high blood pressure etc
many types of cancer like cancer of intestine and prostrate in men then the cancer of reproductive organs uterus ovary breast and gall bladder etc
the disease of joints the disease of liver sleep apnia that is obstruction in breathing for some moments during sleep
in women the irregularity of menstruation and infertility etc happen
some special types of diseases also make the body of the person fatty
hypothyroidism depression consumption of steroids or anti depressant medicines are some such situations when fat starts building up on the body of the person
in women they have seen to become fat especially on the occurrence of the complication of thyroid or after the surgery of uterus
similarly after delivery also they become fat in an abnormal way
although their weight starts increasing during pregnancy but this is the stage of overweight not that the quantity of fat starts increasing on the body
while after giving birth to the child fat only increases on their body gaining control over which is many times beyond their limits
often the meaning of obesity for people is the increase of weight but this is not the right definition of obesity
according to medical experts in the increased weight the weight of everything like muscles bones fat and water are included
while with obesity the meaning is accumulation of fat in body in proportion higher than certain quantity
that is the direct relation of obesity is with fat not with the increased weight of the body
like if we consider body builders and athletes then their weight is very high
despite this body builders and athletes are not fat
body builders and athletes are stay absolutely fit and healthy
but this does not mean at all that fat is bad every ways
it is important that in every human being there should be fat in certain quantity for storage of energy in the body for the maintenance of enough heat to bear the shocks from outside or to other such important works
you are fat or whether you are fat or not to know this it is important to know bmi or body mass index
the easy way to know bmi is bmi weight height lrb square meter rrb
if the bmi is between and then it is considered that the weight of the person is more while people with bmi of or more than are called obese
though bmi is incapable of saying this that in person the quantity of fat is more or that of muscles bones fat and water etc
then also with its help the quantity of fat can be estimated to very great extent
to know this together with the weight of the person his height lrb in square meter rrb is also needed and in height all the organs of the person are included to very great extent
there is no alternative to exercise in reducing obesity but if you feel that strolling morning evening is exercise then it is completely wrong
with exercise the meaning is to bring the heart rate to the level of percent to its rate after doing exercise for to minutes
like if your age is years then your desired heartbeat rate is
your level of exercise is its percent that is it should be par minute
for this anything in cycling jogging aerobics may be included in the daily routine
together with this do yogay also meditation but while doing exercise you must keep certain thing in mind
certainly do warm up five minutes before exercise and cool up after it
for heart patients walking fast jogging or brisk walking are the best exercise but if their has been heart attack recently or there has been bypass surgery then definitely take the advice of the doctor before exercising
with this keep in mind the following things in the daily routine
increase the duration of exercise gradually
take deep breaths while exercising but pay attention not to stop breathing
keep at least an interval of one hour between meal and exercise
do not exercise when you are sad in tension or angry
adopt controlled lifestyle
smoking drinking mental tension fuel the fire therefore escape from them
if you are suffering from some psychological disorder or the disorder of overeating then contact the psychologist or psychiatrist in time
because of more than required weight children are becoming victims of the diseases which occur in adults
increasing obesity in children ahs come up in the form serious problem
children are becoming victims of diseases like diabetes
it has become very important to control obesity
doctors believe that the treatment of obesity should be done in childhood only
because due to obesity on growing up diseases like heart problem diabetes and high blood pressure start cropping up
in maximum children the complaint of obesity is seen in the age of years
during this time the weight of children is more than their age the chance of whose reduction diminish with increasing age
in countries like india increasing urbanisation and globalisation have pit deep impact on the food habits of children
today children relish the fun of tv video game dvd and other electronic gadgets for hours because of which their sports have reduced
also with this the consumption of junk food has also increased in children the cholesterol and sugar which are found in them only become the main reason in increasing the quantity of calorie in the body
because of the reason of these junk food only around to percent children in india become the victims of obesity
by approximately half of the children of the country will come in the clutches of this disease
in survey done recently this thing has come up that in the last years the consumption of oily substances in indian children has increased percent
in children eating candy chocolate pizza hotdog french fries and sweets the number of children in the age from to years is told to be around percent there the number of children from years is told to be approximately percent
first ban should be imposed on the canteens in the schools of children which sell junk food
apart from this at home mother father should pay special attention on the food habits of children by which they eat fibrous fruits and vegetables in more quantity leaving the fatty food
the government of every country should put prohibition on the advertisements of junk food that are shown on the tv
especially that time when children are watching programs on the tv
in every school the period of yoga exercise and pt should certainly be organised because of which their outdoor activity increases
also with this it is important to highlight their performance in the report card of the children by which they themselves also stay alert
the moment the eye of any person falls on the increased fat of his body then immediately his attention goes towards his food and he starts dieting
while for reducing the quantity of fat the requirement is of balanced diet
therefore firstly get your check up done so that it is assured that the weight is not increasing because of any disease
get diet chart made from the dietician according to your height weight age sex and routine that how much calorie you should consume through your food daily
for your convenience some suggestions to control calorie are like this
keep an account of you food and physical activities
mind it that in return to the eaten things you have done labor
if you like eating ice then eat it after taking out the rice water
drink at least two litres of water everyday
consume seasonal fruits vegetables in more and more quantity and consume fruits vegetables of dark color more and more quantity and certainly eat the fruits vegetables of dark color but eat less sweet fruits
do not eat mango banana sapota and grapes
eat more salad and use sprouted pulses also in this
always eat thin dal and eat dal with peels moong dal horse gram dal
for chapatti instead of using flour of mill use thick flour made in millstone with the bran
this mixture of cereals does not let fat increase on the body
bring in use toned milk and instead of curd bring in use curd water mixed with black salt and carom seeds
for cooking bring in use such oil in which there is less cholesterol like soya bean or oil of corn
if there is desire to eat sweets then eat such sweets in which there has been no use ghee like petha in place of gulab jamun
consume less and less of fast food meat ghee oil maida sugar and dry fruits
consume less salt
the direct relation of obesity is with our food habits but the important thing is right eating not less eating
the use of bypass surgery in the treatment of heart diseases is not very old
this has proved to be boon for the heart patients
the obstruction created in the originating part of all the major arteries can be treated with bypass surgery
through the coronary angioplasty method tube is made to reach the arteries of the heart through the medium of the starting point
balloon is fixed on this tube
while putting the tube inside the balloon is deflated
studying the path of this tube on television it is taken to the place of obstruction
right at the pace of obstruction the balloon is inflated
by this the obstruction in the arteries of the heart open up
then the tube is taken out
there are many benefits of this method like less expenditure no need of surgery there is no danger of infection as well and even one does not have to stay in the hospital for more days
but this technique can not be brought into use for all the patients
in opening up blocked arteries proves fruitful
lrb external counter pulsation rrb is one such technique through the medium of which the blocks occurring in the arteries can easily be removed
the moment the obstruction of the arteries are removed the transmission of blood in the body increases
in the medical process of set of three soft strips lrb compressive cuffs rrb is tied on the knees lower thighs upper thighs and hips of the patient
this soft strip keeps inflating and deflating regularly
during this entire process these strips by putting pressure on thighs and hips increase the diastolic coronary perfusion pressure because of which reduction comes in the pressure exerted on the heart
treatment process is very simple and easy
this treatment is given to the patient only for an hour
in total this process continues for hours in weeks
the patient is neither made unconscious during this nor any kind of medicine is given to him
during the entire process of the patient feels very easy
in the immediate diagnosis of heart attack apart from and some special tests of blood at present special type of camera is brought into use
by this camera how much part of the heart has been damaged this can be known
the destroyed muscles of the heart may be diagnosed with the help of gamma camera
according to the heart specialists immediately after heart attack more damage occurs in the heart by the accumulation of blood clots in the coronary arteries
the clot of blood if accumulates on the upper part of the artery then the heart attack becomes serious
because in the upper part of the arteries only the flow of blood is more
on the accumulation of blood clot in the lower part or the last part of the artery the heart attack does not become serious
due to the reasons of the newest technique of medical science removal of blood clots now has become very easy
in the decade of eighties two injections were developed by the american medical scientists to remove these clots which are called streptochynas and urochynas
for the patients of heart these injections have proved to be boon
in the cardiac medical science this technique is known by the name of thrombocytic therapy
but today for the diagnosis of the diseases of the heart newer techniques better than the other are available
the myth that after heart attack life becomes worthless useless and meaningless has changed now very fast
after becoming alright the patient may join their work
the malfunctioning in the muscles of the heart may also be made alright like other diseases
rehabilitation is very important for the patients of the heart
the meaning of rehabilitation is to make the patient capable of working again removal of mental tension and making him able to lead normal life
often after heart attack mental tension and fear start bothering the patient
for leading normal life it is important to remove such apprehensions
there are three important stages of rehabilitation
in the first stage it is important to remove the fear of becoming incapable or death from the mind of the patient
also with this any kind of pressure exerted on the heart is tried to remove
this is that stage when the patient is made healthy mentally
the initiation of making the patient disease free completely takes place in the second stage
in this the person comes out of the bed and also starts climbing up some stairs gradually and at the end he comes back
the complete effort of the doctor is this that once again the patient becomes healthy and active citizen of the society
in the third stage it is tried to make the patient physically and mentally completely healthy
in the saaol natural medication keep the heart disease free
today the number of heart patients is increasing at fast pace
medical science has also gone very far in this direction
with techniques like angioplasty bypass surgery the successful treatment of heart disease is possible
but various research studies on the heart patients reveal that by taking slight precaution in one life pattern style of living and food habits and by doing yoga and exercise the danger of many types of diseases may be averted
the alternative of natural medication is beneficial
the number of heart patients are increasing everyday
people have to undergo expensive and risky surgeries
at times one does not get much time between heart attack and heart fail that the patient may be saved depending on the doctor
but bring such changes in the lifestyle that these types of complications do not come then it would be even better
according to the verdict of dr vimal chhajed the director and the heart specialist of saaol heart center of delhi the alternative of natural treatment is the most beneficial for the patients of heart
after getting the important tests for coronary heart disease the advice for surgery is given to the patient
even after getting the surgery done the patients has to come to the hospital again after two four years
even after such dangerous surgeries when the patient feels complications then the advice to consume the medicine by increasing its dose is given
if the patient adopts the habit of staying continuously in neural and beautiful environment of nature and uses vegetarian food then the permanent diagnosis of these problems may happen
consume less oil and fat in food
by doing yoga morning evening and doing sahaj exercise benefit is received
actually this is natural treatment whose effect provides the body with the ability to make it free of all bodily diseases
saaol that is science and art of living is technique of treatment of heart based on natural treatment
under the saaol heart program the patents are not just given immediate relief but its permanent solution is done through natural medicine
under the saaol natural treatment at first the importance of vegetarian food is told
then under saaol natural treatment habits of yoga in morning evening and meditation etc are adopted
in this treatment there is neither the need of eating medicine nor of getting surgery done
under this medication training of three days is given to the heart patient
the patients are kept in natural places away from the population
during the training the habit of eating vegetarian food of less fat and to endure tension are taught
under this treatment along with yoga practice scientific information related to heart disease are also given
that is during this training the art of new balanced and natural life style is taught to the patient
balanced and fatless food and regular exercise become his daily routine
why is natural treatment esteemed
we have made even more than two and half thousand heart patients disease free with this natural treatment method
in comparison to the availability of many types treatment methods and new medicines in modern medical technique the natural treatment method is more fruitful and beneficial
after getting the treatment done through the natural treatment technique the patient becomes completely disease free
the special thing with natural treatment technique is this that the person adopts such habit that other diseases do not ever cross his path
those people who after taking the training of natural treatment technique continue following its rules the danger of heart problems can never occur to them

handicapness in itself is curse either it is of limbs or mental
it is very difficult to estimate the physical suffering helplessness worthlessness negligence etc occurring due to handicapness
only those can know this whose children have become victims of dangerous diseases like paralysis lrb polio rrb unknowingly
it is the primary duty of every mother father to get the child injected with the vaccine of polio in order to save from handicapness
out of six dangerous diseases occurring in childhood is polio which is called baal pakshaghaat in ayurveda
those children who get this disease their mother father do not know anything related to this from the beginning
objectively by knowing its initial form symptom and by maintaining caution we can save the child from being polio infested
child polio disease at first infects the digestive system
its viruses reach the intestine by entering in the digestive system through the nose and mouth
staying in the intestine they continue to grow
then these viruses after getting mixed with blood damage the nerve cells of the vertebral column on reaching the central nervous system
as result to this the disease of polio appears
although the chance of reaching these viruses to the brain is just one percent
but that same one percent becomes the reason of polio in child
in ayurveda it is called shaishawiya pakshawadha baal pakshaaghaat or adharaang waat
this means the upper or lower part of the body becoming inactive or sensation less
no work can be performed from the polio infested part
there remains no voluntary control over that part
polio is quick developing contagious disease
polio occurs due to three types of polio viruses
which are called polio myelitis type lrb polio myelitis virus type rrb
in human species the disease of polio occurs due to the first and third type of the viruses
the polio viruses do not die quickly
polio spreads from one person to the other
after the infection through the medium of stool or else mouth the discharge of nose it spreads quickly in intestine and throat
the entry of polio in body is through several media getting hurt injection through tonsil during surgery etc
it has been seen such that in the last stage of pregnancy in pregnant woman the chance of its infection is high
the easiest medium of its infection is drinking water food milk eating with dirty hands surrounding dirt etc
not just this the virus of polio spreads from one patient to the other patient also through coughing sneezing and phlegm
the beginning of polio is similar to the symptoms of influenza
the attack of the disease of polio is often sudden
in the beginning the child may get mild fever after this there may be paralysis in the patient
the incubation period of the disease of polio is considered to be to days
the symptoms of the disease generally appear according to the various conditions
in the beginning of the disease fever headache pain in various body parts cough cold digestive problems etc
able doctors also often fail to know that the child is about to contract polio
after some days these symptoms are removed
but after days the symptoms of polio appear
the vertebral column gets stiffened due to the occurrence of fever vomiting dysentery restlessness pain injury in the layer of the brain
because of the reason of polio the child has lot of difficulty in bringing his knee to the mouth while sitting
because of the complication in urinary bladder the urine stops or comes out in less quantity accompanied with pain
after two days even this symptom goes away
the fever goes down but deformity comes in the legs and feet of child
in to days of the beginning of his disease the symptom of paralysis start appearing in his legs and hands
the polio diseases continues to increase for three days
days after the beginning of the polio disease the condition of the patient starts improving
in paralysis the muscles of legs or arms get slackened
later on the muscles of these organs start drying up
but the disease of some children even start reducing gradually
on the disease not getting corrected the hands or feet or both the organs of the child become incapable of movement and locomotion
as there is attack of polio on the child the affected organ becomes inactive dried or lean thin
due to the reason of polio the growth of the child stops
the child becomes lethargic and the intelligence growth of the brain generally gets retarded or blocked
due to the reason of polio fingers along with hand feet joints thighs breast waist area vertebral column etc also get deformed
when the disease gets old on not getting it timely treatment done then its extremely lethal effect falls on spinal nerves and vertebrae of the vertebral column
for protection against it the dose and vaccine of polio are important
in order to escape from this awful and dangerous disease giving dose of polio to child is important
from the age of six months up to nine months of his age at the interval of one month each administer five doses to the child
get the first dose only of polio second third fourth triple injection with polio and the fifth the dose of polio alone
the first booster dose between one and half to two years of age and second booster dose between four and half to five years of age should be administered only once
at present two types of polio vaccine are brought in use for the protection against this disease salk vaccine and sabin vaccine
the use of salk vaccine is done thrice in muscles through injection
first injection in the quantity of six weeks after this second and the third injection is given after to months
with this vaccine for around four years immune power develops against its virus
in this vaccine all the three types of viruses stay mixed lrb diphtheria tetanus and polio rrb
the creation of sabin vaccine is also through three viruses
there is the provision of making the use of sabin vaccine through mouth at the interval of every month continuously for three months three times in total
portions of drops each of sabin vaccine is given empty stomach after mixing in khand with water or milk
the immune power in sabin vaccine is maintained for around years
thus by making use of the polio vaccine according to rules the child may be saved from being infested with polio
according to ayurveda the treatment of polio is done in two ways internal treatment and external treatment
in the internal treatment the use of powder paste aasaw juice and burnt ashes are done
while in the external treatment exercise postures oil massage pack and swedan etc should be adopted
there is benefit by massaging and fomentation on the polio infested organ
for massage bala oil mash oil should be used
for locomotion arrangements may be done for hand vehicle or tricycle or special type of shoes
some beneficial tips for the disease of polio are of the following types

the thread of life of man is tied to heart
till the time the heart stays healthy the life of man goes on smoothly
otherwise on the heart being disease infested he comes in the clutches of many types of heart related diseases
generally it is considered that the direct relation of heart diseases is with the increase in cholesterol
as the quantity of cholesterol increases in body the danger bell for heart gets rung
but in modern experiments one such element has come to be known which is considered to be far more lethal to the heart than the cholesterol
this substance is amino acid named homocystin which is four times more sticky substance than cholesterol
this gets produced in the body during the process of digestion of food only without protein
if its quantity gets increased in the body then ill effects like blockage in the arteries reduction in the work capacity of blood vessels have to be faced
apart from this because of the increase of homocystin alone many lethal effects have to be faced
like reduction in the capacity of blood clotting
with increase in homocystin more production of bad cholesterol
by repairing the dna the work of homocystin stops
consequently disturbance in the genetic construction of the person and the continuation of the disease of increased production of homocystin generation by generation
on the occurrence of homocystin in pregnant woman abortion premature delivery less weight of the child the feet of the child being joined line in the middle of the lips etc may occur
the quantity of homocystin keeps increasing for the entire life time
the quantity of homocystin at least becomes twice from childhood to old age
the quantity of homocystin is more in comparison to women right from youth
but the quantity of hommocystin gradually goes on decreasing with increasing age
in fact the problem of increase of homocystin is found more in the age group of years and is seen more in men
in this also the percentage of indians with this problem is more
in the blood of man mol homocystin should be there
if homocystin is found even percent more in man then the chance of heart attack increases three times
because of increase in homocystin the chances of death increases percent due to disease of heart and percent due to brain and neural diseases
therefore those people who have family history of heart disease for then getting the homocystin test may prove to be blessing
the reasons for increase of homocystin is obesity diabetes high blood pressure smoking etc
apart from this consumption of more coffee and alcohol
less walking increase in bad cholesterol in blood
not taking nutritious food epilepsy some medicines given for the treatment of sugar etc
how should the quantity of homocystin be reduced
for reducing the quantity of homocystin at first it is essential to bring change in your life style and eating habits
scientists have found out that the homocystin may be controlled by increasing the quantity of vitamin and folic acid in food
these vitamins are generally found in colored vegetables and fruits
is found in tandoori chicken tandoori fish wheat whole pulses cabbage and in arhar dal etc
vitamin is found in toned milk toned cheese tandoori fish and the white part of egg

anm bahanji had also said it that if the child faces difficulty in drinking mother milk or his breathing becomes fast then it would have to be taken to the hospital immediately
radha knows that there is complete nutrition in the milk of the mother
therefore for complete four months she fed muniya with her own milk
ors glucose or not even water no matter how much hot or cold it had been
in the initial days do not bathe the child only wipe with cloth
up to four months do not give anything other than mother milk
definitely take the weight of the child
if the child has problem in drinking water or the breathing is fast then immediately take it to big hospital
exactly one and half months after birth radha took muniya to get the vaccine injected
behanji said that vaccine and doses save from six polio like diseases therefore in getting the entire vaccine there should not be mistake
exactly after one month muniya received vaccine and dose again
and one month after it the third time
every vaccine was registered in the mother child protection card and every time behanji reminded radha of coming the next time for the vaccines
behanji also told radha that she should not forget at all the vaccine of diphtheria that would be put in the ninth month of muniya
because of if the vaccine is not given to the child and if diphtheria occurs then after that diseases like dysentery pneumonia malnutrition and sarsaam etc
but on the completion of ninth month muniya got the vaccine of diphtheria and with it she also received the drops of vitamin to save from night blindness
she will continue getting the dose of vitamin every six month up to three years
this you should also remember that on the decided dates you must get the vaccine dose given
every time get the protection card filled
do not forget the vaccine of diphtheria on the completion of ninth month
give the drops of vitamin up to three years
repeated
radha had fed muniya with her own milk from the first month her birth and up to four months she had not given her anything apart from her milk
every month radha had to take the weight of muniya
on sixth month the weight of muniya was twice from that at birth
radha became happy that the weight of muniya had increased correctly according to the saying of behanji
then three four times day radha started feeding muniya half bowl of mashed chapatti dal and vegetables
and with it radha also used to give green leafy vegetables papaya and gourd so that night blindness does not occur to muniya
now muniya is of one year today is her birthday
now her weight is three times of that at birth
every body at home are happy that nurturing of muniya is happening in the correct manner
now radha feeds muniya half bowl of food even five six times in day
you all should also remember that in six months the weight should be doubled
to the child of four to twelve months half bowl of food must be fed three four times day
the weight should be three times on the completion of one year
from twelve to eighteen months feed half bowl food five six times day
one day muniya started getting loose motion
radha became worried she remembered the saying of behanji that because of repeated dysentery the water of the body and the salts come out and there may even be danger to his life
immediately as per told by bahanji radha started giving liquid items found in the house repeatedly to muniya
like the water of dal starch water of rice lemonade or light tea
but together with these things behanji had also asked to give but that there was no at home
sohan brought packet from anganwari
radha made solution according to the process told by bahanji
and made muniya drink after every dysentery
next day radha threw the leftover solution and made fresh solution
apart from this she also continued feeding complete meal to muniya
in two three days the dysentery stopped on its own and muniya became alright
everyone should remember it always that as dysentery starts in child keep giving domestic liquid things after every dysentery
deficiency of water in body is very dangerous therefore keep giving solution as well
at least give half bowl of food four five times in day certainly and even after this there is dysentery then take her to health center
the treatment of cough cold may be done even in the house
therefore on contracting cold radha treated muniya this way
by making her drink tulsi tea and mixing ginger juice and lemon juice in honey
by giving more and more things to drink and by feeding regularly
muniya became alright in three four days
but radha thought if her condition would have become worse even after doing everything
bahanji counselled that the meaning of such happening is pneumonia and there are three symptoms to recognize it stopping of food drinks fast breathing and rib movement
in such situation take the child to bahanji immediately and get her administered the medicine of pneumonia
if bahanji tells then immediately go to big hospital and get her checked up
if due to any reason you do not find bahanji then also take the child to big hospital immediately
muniya did not even become of one year that mother in law started expressing the desire for grandson
radha asked bahanji she said that it will take two to three years for the weakness that has come in the body after the birth of muniya to go away
as such if there is pregnancy then there may be problem as well as complication and the prospective child may also stay weak
also muniya will stop getting mother milk and her care will also not be taken
radha understood the meaning of more and frequent children is disease in the destiny of child malnutrition and twelve months of money crunch
bahanji told easy and reliable ways of contraception
after discussion sohan and radha chose the right way and decided that for three years they would not produce second child
you should also remember that there should be gap of three years between two children
conception before three years is bad for the health of mother and child
for keeping gap between two children use condom pills or copper
on stopping the these methods second child may be given birth to
one day some people did counsel after coming to the village radha and sohan also went the discussion happened regarding the stopping of disease through hygiene
after toilet putting soil or ash over it
after washing the hands properly only feeding the child and using clean water
to protect food from dirt and flies
burning the garbage of the household or burying it in the ground
not letting water accumulate near well or hand pump
through all these things the prevention of diseases may happen to great extent
everybody liked the talks and with the help of institution and panchayat people completed these together
sohan and radha in fact even swore to ward off dirt and disease
after some days the result also came in front as dirt lessened the diseases too started reducing
diabetes has taken the form of an epidemic in the world and its various kinds of social and financial adverse effects are also coming forward
in the patients of diabetes diabetes foot is an extremely serious problem
do you know that in the world every year the foot of lakh patients has to be amputated because of diabetes foot
thus in the whole world in every seconds surgery of amputating the foot of certain patient afflicted with diabetes foot takes place
my intention of telling you these figures is not to frighten you but to caution you
by researches done in this regard it has been proved that by good care it is possible to escape from the problem of diabetes foot to great extent
hence it is necessary that patients of diabetes should know this well what effect of this disease can occur on feet and how the care of feet should be taken
the ancient proverb of prevention is better than cure is absolutely successful in diabetes disease
there is chance of occurrence of ulcer in feet to the patients of diabetes due to the following two reasons
in the patients of diabetes because of damage occurring in the nervous system there is decline in capability to feel in their feet and they do not feel pain at all due to which wound or injury in feet does not get detected in time
in patients of diabetes because of flaccid blood circulation wounds or injuries heal late and on occurrence of small wound danger of infection keeps lurking
such people whose blood level is high can suffer from diabetes foot
hence if you are ever told such that you have diabetes or there is likelihood of occurrence of diabetes then you should definitely save your feet from getting hurt and you should also take proper care of them
in patients of diabetes the likelihood of diabetes foot increases if you have diabetes neuropathy
if blood circulation is flaccid in your feet
if there is deformity in your feet like there is corn or hammertoe in feet
if you wear shoes of wrong shape or design
if you are afflicted with uncontrolled blood sugar
if you smoke beedicigarette drink alcohol or your cholesterol level stays high
if because of diabetes there has been ulcer in your feet ever before
if because of diabetes you have disease of kidneys heart or eyes
the main causes of diabetes foot lrb ulcer and infection in feet rrb are
due to bite of wrong sized or new shoes
wounds in feet like wounds occurred unknowingly by shoe bite or by walking barefoot those which patient is unable to detect
blisters occurred by burning lrb like because of bath by extremely hot water bottle of hot water heat radiator etc rrb
infection of corn plaster and nails
wound occurred by continuously staying in bed of patient lrb bed blisters rrb
deformity in feet like kinak clawed nail corn etc
care of diabetic patient and feet
in preventing diabetes the role of the patient himself is most important
patients should examine their feet everyday on regular basis
patients should look at the upper and lower parts of their feet attentively everyday
patients should also examine the parts between their fingers and parts near the ankle close to heel regularly
patients should keep in mind if there is no wound cut or pain anywhere while examining their feet regularly
if there is no crack or cut in the skin of feet of patient
if the skin of feet of patient is not dry or soft
if there is no swelling in one foot or leg of the patient
if there is no formation of warts or kinak in feet of patients
change in the nails growing on the inner side of fingers like nails getting thick or colourless is sign of diabetes foot
occurrence of blisters on skin is also sign of diabetes foot
occurrence of hot cold spots on skin is sign of diabetes foot
to prevent diabetes foot keep an eye on changes in blood circulation
keep an eye on color of fingers also
by your sitting on chair etc on hanging your legs if color of fingers of your feet starts becoming red pink or purple then blood circulation in your feet is not right
do not be indifferent to pain in feet
if at night or by walking little you start feeling pain in legs then understand that blood circulation in certain vessel is blocked
if there is problem in your nails like hard nail then cut your nails carefully or get help from professional
do not cut your nails quite deep rather cut straight
if nails are left pointed then file them
if you are troubled by corn or warts then never cut corn or warts yourself
do not use corn pad also because skin burns by this and can take form of an ulcer
safe cure for wart or kinak is only that you should consult therapist
everyday in the morning and before sleeping wash your feet with lukewarm water and use moderate soap
before washing your feet kindly ensure that water is not extremely hot
wipe your feet with soft towel of light color and wipe between your fingers carefully so that skin there does not get scraped by rubbing
after wiping your feet examine your feet carefully if there are no signs of blood of pus on it
if you find signs of blood or pus then consult therapist quickly
after wiping apply talcum powder between feet and fingers so that there remains no wetness
if because of certain reason you have to keep your feet in water then do not keep for more than minutes because by being in water for long time skin of feet becomes extremely soft
foot spa may prove harmful for patients of diabetes especially who have disease related to neuropathy or pulse
if your feet are getting dry then apply cream so that there are no cracks
do not apply cream between fingers
if feet are too dry then use cream twice day
make selection of your cream only on consulting therapist because for extremely dry feet special cream containing urea is available
be careful that inside the house pointed things like needle insulin syringe or pin etc do not remain lying on the floor
patients of diabetes should not walk barefoot
by walking barefoot there surely stays chance of getting injured rather extreme pressure is also exerted on feet due to absence of support from shoes
wear thick socks and shoes should also be comfortable and of appropriate size
examine your shoes and socks from time to time and before wearing shake it from top to bottom so that if there is pointed thing etc it should come out
be careful that feet do not come in direct contact with things like bar heater or bottle of hot water because skin may burn by it
to keep skin warm wear thick socks
once year definitely get your feet examined by specialists of foot care lrb podiatrist rrb
patients of diabetes should maintain special caution about shoes
often chance of occurrence of ulcer increases by wearing new shoes
if you buy new shoes then first see them wearing in the house for minutes
if shoes bite some part of your foot or exert extreme pressure then get the cobbler to loosen the shoe bit else buy new shoes
never stay wearing new shoe for the whole day
it will be better that you take the shoes to the podiatrist
do not wear open slippers or sandals and do not wear shoes without socks
wear leather or vinylmesh mix shoes
shoes should be broad and open so that feet fit in properly
shoes should be of round toes
the part that supports the heel of the shoe should be tough so that it does not become flat
tie the leather straps properly or wear the shoes by means of velcro so that feet stay in comfortable position
the sole of shoes should be flexible and about cm thick
the interior of the shoes should be soft
while buying shoes putting hand in the shoes check if the interior of the shoes is not rough
buy new shoes after noon because feet swell during the day
often shoes bought in the morning do not fit in the evening
prior to buying shoes in the evening take measure of your foot on cardboard thereafter buy new shoes on the basis of its measure
it is said that to delay is better than an accident but by delaying in case of diabetes foot an accident may occur
therefore from today rather from now itself start taking care of your feet in the right manner because the best cure for diabetes is its prevention only
even then if the symptoms of diabetes foot are visible to the patient of diabetes in his feet then without delaying consult your therapist immediately
diabetes has taken the shape of an epidemic in the world today
in india the number of patients of diabetes is more than in all the countries in the world
today approximately crore people are afflicted with diabetes in india and by there is likelihood of this number reaching to crores
the main cause of disease of diabetes is comfortable lifestyle obesity and excess in population of old people
therefore we get to see the number of patients of diabetes more in cities as compared to villages
there is an estimate that patients living in metropolitan cities do not know that they have come into the clutches of diabetes disease
comparatively with the southern countries indians are becoming prey to diabetes in youth itself
because of which there is great harm to the economy also
diabetes is of two types typei and typeii but in india patients are of typeii only and only patients are found to be of typei
during the past years number of typeii patients is increasing continuously
in the condition before occurrence of diabetes lrb prediabetic rrb on examining blood on an empty stomach level of glucose increases and glucose tolerance becomes abnormal
it is that condition when glucose in blood is more than normal but person can not be called diabetes patient yet
from prediabetic patients people come into category of diabetes each year
this is good news that prevention of diabetes is possible
along with change in lifestyle prevention of diabetes is possible by proper use of medicine
researches tell that healthy diet lrb less calorie less fatacidic and fiber in abundance rrb and through regular exercise lrb everyday minutes and times in week rrb diabetes can be reduced by in people of abnormal glucose tolerance
by giving medicines like metformin acrabase and glitazones reduction can be brought in cases of diabetes in people of abnormal glucose tolerance
in diabetes life threatening large and minute complications can be born in the vessels
to prevent these complications aid of heart vessel and pancreas transplant and laser photocoagulation can be taken
due to these chances of occurrence of blindness disfigurement and premature death can be there
diabetes of pregnancy can prove to be harmful for mother and child both
the complications of diabetes can be stopped from increasing
it has been proven from both studies diabetes control and complications trial lrb in categoryi diabetes rrb and united kingdom prospective lrb category ii diabetes rrb that it is possible to prevent minute vessel complications by intensive glucose control nevertheless through intensive glucose control controlling large vessel complications is not that significant
through blood pressure control intensive lipid management and antiplatelet therapy these complications can be reduced in significant manner
these complications can be stopped in significant manner by keeping strict control on all these abnormal processes and expense that is incurred on the patient is also less
cure of diabetes and related complications is expensive
an expense of about rs can come every year on the treatment of patient
cure can be more expensive if complications of patient increase else he has to be admitted to the hospital
there is an expense of more than rs crore on the therapy of indian diabetes patients
strict control on the glucose level of diabetes patient is difficult because the danger of occurrence of hypoglycemia in them can increase by it
by new medicines like insulin analog inhaled insulin peptidei lrb exenatide rrb like glucagon meglitinide derivative dppiv inhibitors control of level of glucose can be done without the danger of hypoglycemia
despite of being acquainted with advantages of strict control on glucose blood pressure control and lipid control only patients are able to have this control and out of these also only patients are able to have control over all of these
it is necessary to spread information about researches that happen on diabetes and control related cures on massive level
if diabetes and its complications are not stopped from taking dreadful form then in developing country like india catastrophic circumstances can originate
here even today we can not control the pathologies and mortality rate due to infectious diseases and prenatal diseases
for this we will have to bring changes in lifestyle of common man
we will have to examine people who have more danger of occurrence of diabetes we will have to take more care of prediabetic patients we will have to control the glucose level and we will have to control the blood pressure and lipid of diabetic patients
although doing this is extremely difficult but it is necessary to achieve these goals
seeing the large number of patients of diabetes it will not be inappropriate to call india diabetes capital
currently number of diabetes patients in india is about lakh
there is chance of this number increasing to become about lakh in
there are number of reasons behind cases of diabetes increasing suddenly in india
having congenital reasons having much weight imitation of western lifestyle sensitivity stomach fat and insulin resistance lrb with less weight rrb
diabetes can affect various body parts
nervous system eyes kidneys bones etc also have not escaped this epidemic
by diabetes disorders can occur in bones joints and muscles and nerves
because of which stiffness in joints swelling ulcers in feet decaying of feet else feet can become dark
if proper control is not kept over diabetes then bone related diseases can occur
if an elderly woman is afflicted with category diabetes then danger of bone breaking increases by it
if bone breaks then it takes long time for it to join
in addition to this bones become basically weak because due to deficiency in insulin developmental process of bones stops
this does not happen in category ii diabetes afflicted as most of the patients of this category are fat as result of which their bones are also big and strong
hence patients of category require an average of mg calcium and to units vitamin everyday
dose of osteoporosis is necessary for patients of category like common patients
according to an interesting research if baby is given vitamin then danger of occurrence of category diabetes reduces
there is more chance of occurrence of infection to patients of diabetes
various deformities and mortality rate can increase in patients due to infection
there can be various reasons for its basis
immunity reducing nerves of body or nervous system getting affected negatively glucose level increasing in skin
the level of amount of glucose in skin exceeding danger of bone infection increases
hence controlled amount of glucose is necessary in surgeries related to bones like joint transplant and treatments like joining or setting broken bone
if level of glycosylated hemoglobin increases by then by that danger of occurrence of abscess or ulcer increases by and danger of amputating body part increases by
here it is reasonable to discuss the topic of diabetes and infection of feet because it is found so in most cases
due to the reason that sensory nerves get damaged the feeling of hot and cold and injury in feet gets reduced and feet get continually damaged
by damage of nerves that are manager of muscles there can be paralysis in feet feet can become deformed or twisted
by exertion of more pressure on less space chance of formation of ulcer increases
in this manner by damage of nerves that control the temperature of skin skin gets worse
because of blockage in the blood circulation of feet proper nutrition is unable to reach the feet and less white blood cells reach there
some white cells that reach get damaged because of diabetes since these cells save the body from infection
hence immunity becomes less
bone diseases occurring due to diabetes are in this manner
weakening of bones change coming in the walk lrb balance of body is not maintained by blockage of nerves rrb occurrence of decrease in immunity wound not filling up fast getting an infection again and again from wound not healing and consequently from these diseases starting from handicap of patient even death can occur
because of diabetes infection of feet begins from the soles of feet
in the beginning there is redness in skin which remains even after pressing
skin gets tough
there can be formation of ulcer by injury in foot that reaches the muscles and bones and pus can develop in foot fingers can degenerate or darken
you should cure patient immediately surgery and amputation of foot are also combined in the treatment
infection of foot because of diabetes is state of emergency
it is necessary to do the amputation of foot in of the cases and treatment of patient on admitting in hospital in of the cases
in indian patients cause of cases of ulcer in feet is diabetes
there is influence on joints because of diabetes
disease named charcot joint can occur to out of patients of patients afflicted with diabetes
the difference between infection and charcot is this that in charcot feet of patients are red swollen and twisted and patient does not have any pain in it and patient does not have fever
specific kind of test might be necessary to detect charcot joint
aid of diabetes control lrb glucose control in blood rrb plaster of specific shape shoes and surgery can be taken in the treatment
because of diabetes bones become weak and so they can break soon
specific caution is required during treatment because there remains chance of the body part degenerating in the plaster
danger of infection during surgery can also increase because of diabetes
it takes time for the bone to join in diabetes
as result of the bone breaking often deformity can occur in joints also
flexibility of joints ends by accumulation of glucose in joints with this deformity can arise in skin of joints and bone fibers consequently stiffness can occur in joints
skin of hands of patients of diabetes becomes thick stiff like wax and dried up
fingers of hands stiffen and snap on bending
this is also called trigger finger
the whole hand on some patients gets twisted then distortion comes in forefinger of some patients which is known by the name of dupuytren
because of these difficulties patients can not even perform the action of namaskar properly
aid of exercise injection of steroid in nerves and hands and surgery is taken for treatment
normally shoulders of both arms get jammed else stiffness occurs in them because of which patients can not even comb their hair
patients become unsuccessful in rotating their arms behind their waist or above
it takes long time for such patients to recover
aid of exercise injection of steroid in joints telescope or general surgery is taken for treatment
nerves get deformed due to diabetes
blockage occurs in blood circulation in vessels by excess of glucose in blood and other defects can also arise in vessels because of which most patients lose balance related control of sense and body
many problems like shock in hands and feet feeling burning sensation in hands and feet going numb occurrence of paralysis and fingers getting distorted can originate
defect can also arise in the muscles of feet and patient is unable to walk properly
occurrence of problem like compression of nerve by thickening and stiffening of skin near and inside joints and by blood circulation not occurring normally is common symptom
mostly nerves of wrists can compress by compression of medial nerve of wrist carpal tunnel syndrome occurs
in this pain shock and numbness which usually increases at night time occur in thumb and with it in two and half fingers
this difficulty can also happen to patients of diabetes by working on the computer in wrong position or working much holding the newspaper etc
this problem occurs more in patients of diabetes in those doing work related to much bending and rotating of wrist
the treatment of every problem in diabetes starts with control of glucose in blood through medicines
hence control on amount of glucose is vital to prevent adverse effects on nerves because of diabetes
in addition to this treatment is done by pain killers vitamins pancreas transplant
main cause of disease of kidneys is diabetes generated disease
in their lifetime about diabetes patients get afflicted with disease of kidneys
disease of kidneys occurring due to diabetes is called nephropathy
this disease is detected in diabetes patients when protein products in urine are found to be mg on running urine test
in comparison to white people the chance of occurrence of diabetes generated kidney disease in asian indians is times more
on initial level kidney disease in diabetes patients is detected via special test when the level of their albumin is found abnormal rrb lrb mg per day rrb
this level is called insipient diabetic nephropathy
the danger of kidney and heart disease to such patients is more
this disease can be stopped via initial diagnosis and proper treatment of disease
the following are the causes of diabetes generated kidney disease
having disease of diabetes for long time
not having proper control on blood glucose
high blood pressure heredity race smoking etc can also be causes of diabetes generated kidney disease
diabetes generated kidney disease occurs because of protein urea lrb on increase in amount of protein in urine rrb and glomerular filtration rate lrb rrb
the main cause of diabetes generated kidney disease is uncontrolled level of blood glucose in body
however imbalance of blood glucose in body is harmful for cells and other body parts which can become cause of various kinds of ailments
hence it is possible to prevent diabetes generated kidney disease to quite an extent keeping level of blood glucose controlled in diabetes patients and diagnosing the disease on the preliminary level and detecting microalbumin urea in the urine
urine of hours is tested to detect microalbumin urea
this is the most reliable test for detecting microalbumin urea
for the diagnosis of insipient diabetic nephropathy ratio of albumin and retaining is detected in urine
it is also possible to do this test by recent sample of urine
preliminary prevention is having control on blood glucose
the normal level of hbac blood glucose is up to
chances of other complications arising because of diabetes remain less till this level but on hbac being more than all relative efforts should be made to control blood glucose
by reduction of lrb about mg of blood glucose per day rrb in hbac there is reduction of in diabetic retinopathy and to in diabetic nephropathy
therefore diabetes patient can prevent other disease occurring from this disease by keeping proper control on blood glucose
diabetes patients should keep blood pressure less than
reducing blood pressure from to means reducing diabetes generated kidney disease by
it remains quite useful to give medicines like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for keeping level of blood pressure maintained normal
it is important for prevention of kidney disease that you reduce the amount of protein going in the urine of patient you maintain proper control on blood glucose and blood pressure
take appropriate therapy for anemia lipid ailment and treat it taking antibiotic medicines or injections of insulin on much increase in amount of glucose
conclusively you can say that diabetes generated kidney disease is the main cause of kidney failure
hence diabetes patients should keep doing their regular checkup so that preliminary diagnosis of the diabetes generated kidney disease is possible and through relative treatment the disease is stopped from advancing
condition of ailments related to metabolism of glucose fats and proteins in body or complete deficiency of insulin is called diabetes
in both there is adverse effect on processes of various body parts like metabolism nervous system by defect in insulin and increase in glucose level and immunity system and skin also gets affected by it
in most of the diabetes afflicted patients changes related to skin are seen
however in most of the cases causes of changes that occur in skin remain unknown
because of occurrence of defect in vessels nerves or because of decrease in immunity in body due to excess of glucose and imbalanced level of insulin skin related disease occur in diabetes patients
because of diabetes such substances get accumulated below skin and inside skin by which skin becomes thick and tough
normally such situation arises at that time when residual substances do not get out of skin through sweat
because of diabetes activities of joints become limited
in some patients due to accumulation of proteins in the fingers of hands and feet there is inconvenience in trying to move them and their efficiency is affected badly
various types of wounds and injuries occur in feet and legs on increase in level of glucose in blood or not consuming the medicines properly
because of these wounds and injuries specific kind of fluid gets stored in the arteries
in some cases blood circulation can lessen or stop in the skin of body
because of diabetes deep wounds that are nonhealing occur
efficiency of nervous system gets adversely affected by excess of glucose in arteries that convey blood to the nervous system
as result of which that organ or part of body goes numb and injury in numbed parts can not be detected and the danger of occurrence of infection in the wound is retained
excess of glucose makes the immune system of the body also atrophic
by which microbes germs admitted in the body do not terminate because of which body becomes prey to any kind of infection soon
some of the main microbes of these are in this manner streptococcus staphylococcus coli tuberculosis virus herpes zoster herpes simplex fungi candida micromyosis dermatofitosis etc
occurrence of rashes and boils in body because of diabetes is common problem
in addition to this fatal diseases like necrotizing fasciitis and cellulites carbuncle can also occur
blood related disease named mucormycosis can occur because of diabetes
amount of fat in body increases due to diabetes
amount of glucose increases because of specific enzyme by which efficiency of body reduces or ends
red and yellow rashes develop on skin
though these rashes can be in any part of the body but generally they are more near the joints
rashes named jennthomas develop by amount of cholesterol or triglycerides increasing in blood
certain part of skin of body becomes dark and thick because of abnormality of diabetes
sometimes disease named acanthosis nigricans can also occur
in addition to this following diseases are also seen because of diabetes like malignant otitis media rhinocerebral mucormycosis pseudomonas infection bullosis diabeticorum necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum etc
caution to prevent adverse effects of diabetes
keep doing physical exercise
have meals on time
meals should be clean and nutritious in which all required elements are combined
take medicines on time and on regular basis
by these cautions you can keep yourself safe from the adverse effects of diabetes
in only of patients of diabetes symptoms of nerve diseases are seen whereas in up to patients muscle deformities and nerve related defects are found
symptoms of nerve diseases are found most in patients of years of age and above lesser in those below years of age and in about negligible amount in patients in childhood
because of diabetes many forms of nerve related diseases are found
in diabetes ophthalmoplegia there are eye related complications
in serious mononeuropathy outburst of disease is seen in form of muscle deformity of muscles of arms and body
mononeuropathy disease advances fast
there is acute pain in mononeuropathy disease
neuropathy disease affects the main organs in an unequal way
in mononeuropathy disease main muscles become weak and their weight decreases
in mononeuropathy disease there is no pain in muscles there is lack of consciousness
during mononeuropathy disease sometimes the disease seems to be increasing then sometimes it appears to be decreasing
remote like preliminary sensory polyneuropathy affects feet and legs instead of hands
polyneuropathy advancing gradually takes the form of serious disease
in self conducted nerve defect generally bladder and blood circulatory system are affected more
abdominal nerve defect and radiculopathy generally occur together
particularly remote sensory nerve defect and abdominal nerve defect occur together
hyperglycemia that is level of glucose in blood increases which takes nerves into its clutches
it has recently been seen in researches that with the aid of medicines the effect that it has on hyperglycaemic nerves can be influenced through right balance between impaired glucose tolerance and peripheral neuropathy
innumerable changes in relation to pathology are being seen in both myelinated and unmyelinated kinds of fibers
the main causes of peripheral neuropathy are not fully known now
according to metabolic theory amount of glucose inside cells that completely surround the glycolytic pathway increases
according to vascular theory due to increase of endoneurial vascular resistance of hyperglycaemic blood endoneurial ischemia increases
according to altered neurotrophic sport theory neuropathic factors play the main role for maintenance development and repair of nervous system
according to laminin theory the formation of laminin beta in less than the normal amount plays the main role in diabetic neuropathy defect
according to auto immune theory demyelination is found in cranial and peripheral nerves
the third and sixth nerve of brain may get affected by infection of head and back bone in serious mononeuropathy diabetes and it takes long time for it to heal
the problem of multiple mononeuropathy and radiculopathy mostly affects the elderly patients of diabetes
in multiple mononeuropathy there is pain in the same way in many nerves
multiple mononeuropathy and radiculopathy can occur in relatively less diabetes also
weakness and undernourishment can occur in pelvic girdle and muscles close to it but effect can be seen on remote muscles also
in this disease the upper body parts get affected very less
symptoms of remote polyneuropathy diabetes are mostly like normal diabetes neuropathy
symptoms of remote polyneuropathy are numbness shock and continuous pain
normally in this disease right symptoms are found in legs feet and toes mostly at night time
the clinical depiction of it is such that deep intensive decline contractions of bladder and atrophy in hands feet arises
efficiency of pupil of eye and tear glands can end by autonomic neuropathy
you do not sweat in autonomic neuropathy blood circulation gets affected
digestive system gets affected by autonomic neuropathy
flaccidity occurs in gastrointestinal system bladder and genitals by autonomic neuropathy
blood pressure can also fall by autonomic neuropathy
protein becomes to mg per cm or exceeds this too in every kind of diabetes neuropathy
autonomic neuropathy disease occurs on the basis of spinal nerves and ganglions getting affected
mostly damage by it is found in myelinated nerve fiber
demyelination and remyelination can also be seen in the remaining fibers of axon
and are special accessories in the diagnosis research
regular examination of level of blood glucose is extremely necessary
there is only one goal of treatment that the level of blood glucose remains normal and controlled because it is connected with the damage of nerves
in autonomic neuropathy through treatment by medicines like aldose inhibitor and albesterine weakness of patient may go
shock reduces and there is relief from pain by use of these medicines
there is recent mention of ordinary component like gangliosides in neuronal membrane literature but you get relief by it only to an extent
the patients who have retained problems like numbness and shock in hands feet for long time you can give them amitriptyline medicine or anti distress like neuro generation
benefit also occurs by use of fluoxetine or sertraline
you can stop fluctuations of unbearable pain by carbamazepine and fenitoina or gabapentin or pregabalin
but normally results of these medicines are not satisfactory
but sometimes better results are seen by neurontin
nerve block and epidural injections are beneficial for some patients
there is pain for some duration in proximal asymmetrical or ophthalmologic neuropathy which can be controlled by analgesic like diclofen acetaminophen or tramadol
the future of patients of remote preliminary sensory neuropathy is uncertain
but many times it may take months or even years in other improvements and getting relief to some extent
hence remember that on falling in the clutches of diabetes your life can become crippled because it can damage your nervous system also
therefore always consume healthy balanced and nutritious diet by which control remains maintained on your blood glucose
exercise and yoga also prove to be very advantageous
it is possible to stop long term complications of diabetes keeping control on the level of glucose in blood
in the beginning you can have control on sugar in diabetes disease through pills
but gradually pills stop showing effect
to keep proper control on sugar it becomes important to take insulin
if your doctor directs insulin then definitely take it
nearly crore people in our country are afflicted with diabetes and there is chance of its increasing to crore by
world health organisation has called india to be the capital of diabetes
other than the family history sometimes some people do not have any specific problem or complaint and it is found only after testing that they are prey of this disease
the women who have blood related disease of diabetes or are themselves diabetic should plan their family only after controlling this disease fully before conceiving taking advice of doctor and doing tests
sometimes patients are kept on pills for this disease
you may need to get insulin injections stopping the pills on advice of doctor
if this disease is for long duration then you may need to test eyes kidneys heart and nervous system
during the first three months of pregnancy if blood glucose is not controlled properly then chance of occurrence of congenital defect in child is lot more
if such situation arises after pregnancy then weight of child in the womb may be above kg and he may die in the womb
because of hormones that come out of the umbilical cord during pregnancy and pancreatic insulin that forms specially in body of women and the change in its use in the body some women get diabetes during pregnancy
this diabetes is known by the name of gestational diabetes
whether pregnant woman in normal conditions has diabetes or not for this she is tested through gct lrb glucose challenge test rrb during weeks of pregnancy
for the test the woman doest not have to eat anything for two hours after her breakfast and after that she has to drink grammes glucose
one hour after drinking glucose she has to give her blood sample
if it is more than mg then there is chance of
then the woman is required to do gtt lrb glucose tolerance test rrb that is of grammes glucose
any two or more readings being more than normal the woman is considered afflicted with diabetes
such women who have pregnancy along with diabetes lrb rrb should be under special care of an obstetrician and gynaecologist
some special tests should be run on pregnant women
you should do foetal echo or ultrasound level ii for foetus
by which the child being healthy can be detected to quite limit
in the last weeks of pregnancy woman should keep note of turns by the foetus lrb kick count rrb
in which the woman has to note the turning of child lying down for an hour in the morning an hour during daytime and an hour at night
during these three hours child should turn ten or more times
in addition to this health of child can be detected to quite an extent by or through ultrasound lrb non stress test rrb
besides these it is important to run all tests on diabetes afflicted pregnant woman that are told to an ordinary pregnant woman
she should take note of the following things just as she finds out that she has complaint of diabetes
take the right and nutritious diet
keep complete details of weight increase during pregnancy lrb kg rrb
do regular tests of blood glucose
take the correct and regular treatment
deliver in hospital on time
diabetes also means calorie control along with moderation from sugar rice potato sweets or fruits
woman with normal weight should take calories kg according to her weight and woman with much weight should take calories kg
the gist is this that she can take to calories of food in hours
she should make use of carbohydrates proteins and remaining fats
out of this you should take in breakfast in lunch at night and the remaining calories in snacks
you can take amount of the total energy every time in the morning afternoon and before bed
normally during pregnancy weight of woman with normal weight increases by kg and weight of woman with much weight by kg
pregnant woman afflicted with diabetes should lrb after meals rrb walk daily times for minutes
woman afflicted with diabetes should soon learn to test her blood glucose and to apply injections of insulin
you run test of sugar monitoring times day
before breakfast before lunch two hours after meals and one at in the morning
in the beginning you test everyday and later once or twice week
you can detect the state of last weeks of blood glucose by tests of fructosamine and hbac
when condition of application of insulin arrives patient should be admit in hospital and should keep glucose powder or biscuit with himself
if blood glucose comes down lot which is called hypoglycemia then immediately take sugar glucose or biscuit
there can be complaint of weakness agitation dizziness sweating and fumbling with words
amount of insulin is increased or decreased from time to time by advice of doctor
you can also give injections of insulin later yourself or with help from relative at home according to advice of doctor
you can also do sugar monitoring lrb empty stomach hours after lunch hours after dinner rrb
you wait for childbirth for whole weeks in cases in which glucose control is good in them
if disease of diabetes is detected late or is uncontrolled then in such condition in pregnancy of weeks you deliver artificially through medicines
during labor you do blood glucose test of these patients quickly and glucose and insulin is given from time to time
in many women because of large size of children pain or high blood pressure childbirth happens by surgery
in the beginning you give glucose to child later mother should breast feed the child again and again in hours
gradually you can increase it to hours
complaint of diabetes during pregnancy becomes alright after childbirth also but it hints at future danger of diabetes to the woman
this happens to nearly women in about to years
this time can be increased by moderation in food control on weight and regular exercise
can occur soon or in severity in the next pregnancy
hence before conception and in the beginning of pregnancy you should test blood glucose
miscarriage congenital defects in children especially diseases of bones and heart can occur in uncontrolled diabetes
in pregnant women according to duration and seriousness of diabetes dangerous difficulties like eye disease heart disease kidney disease high blood pressure along with stroke can occur
by infection lot of difficulties can occur in treatment of pregnant woman with diabetes
you can lead simple and good life by taking care of yourself and following advice of doctor
the use of appropriate device for family planning is wisdom
you can take contraceptive pills easily you can take only progesterone or contraceptive pills with it both
it is necessary to test glucose amount in blood from time to time
if diabetes is properly controlled by pills and insulin then you can do laparoscopic sterilisation to keep family restricted
it is absolutely necessary to beware and cautious of diabetes for health
certain difficulties like obesity high blood pressure cancer of genitals etc increase danger of diabetes with aging
there is saying that prevention is better than cure then be careful when there is time
make less use of sugar and sweets do not let weight increase do exercise and yoga
disease of diabetes can occur in new born baby also
disease of diabetes that is found in small children is known in the form of type in the medical world the meaning of which is deficiency of insulin or dependence on insulin
in this deficiency of those cells occurs in pancreas gland that make insulin
according to survey the number of diabetes afflicted children is different in various races countries
on the basis of survey where you find number of new cases in karachi lrb pakistan rrb to be per lakh there in finland you find it to be per lakh and here this number increases per year
in america in about children children are afflicted with diabetes
but the main cause is genetic in which defect can occur in many genes and you do its classification on that basis itself
in addition to this other causes present in environment infection chemicals geographical causes and food etc are main
rubella virus is main in infection
to detect the chances of this disease we have to take the aid of genetic antibodies and metabolic markers
the foremost genetic locus is class ii
yes disease of type diabetes can occur in the week before birth itself and it cures on it own after staying for few weeks or months
you get to see disease of type diabetes mainly in those children whose weight is less
you see the same symptoms that is symptoms of urination and deficiency of water in these children also
the treatment of these is also less sugar and insulin
you see the irregularity of chromosome in it
but disease of diabetes that is found in some children can stay for life
amount of insulin that pancreas produces getting imbalanced is its main cause
disease of diabetes ii that occurs in older children that is in the age of years is like disease of diabetes occurring in adults only and its treatment is also possible with medicines like the disease of adults
disease of diabetes is mainly found in their parents also and its treatment also depends on pills
it is also necessary to keep control on food etc
if there is not enough insulin in the body or there is some kind of defect in insulin then glucose is unable to enter the stores of body and keeps getting accumulated in quite an amount in the blood circulation
this condition is called diabetes
diabetes is very unmanageable and difficult disease
in this disease patient can keep himself healthy paying enough attention to food and his lifestyle
medicines work in diabetes disease only when diet of the patient is suitable
diabetes occurs because of heredity obesity being seated all the time defect of liver etc
diabetes patient feels very thirsty and also very hungry
there is an urge to urinate again and again but urine comes out in small amount every time
the disease resistance capacity of diabetes patient reduces
because of diabetes boils rashes itching herpes etc diseases begin
diabetes patient can have high blood pressure and heart disease
there are many easy ways of keeping amount of glucose balanced in diabetes
bitter gourd is as beneficial as ambrosia in diabetes
with use of bitter gourd glucose reduces quite lot in blood
by consumption of water of fenugreek seeds regularly for two months patients of diabetes get special benefit
indian blackberry also proves to be efficient in diabetes disease
patient of diabetes gets special benefit by bringing in use indian blackberries everyday
you should also include bottle gourd cucumber gherkin tomatoes indian gooseberry green leafy vegetables in your diet
consuming porridge is best in diabetes disease
afflicted with obesity and heart patients can also consume this porridge
you should also use buttermilk in your diet regularly
you can bridle diabetes by having regular meals doing exercise yogasana and having stroll
diabetes is such metabolism related disease that affects various parts of body
because of this disease mainly blood arteries and nerves get affected
when damage occurs in arteries and nerves of retina of eye because of diabetes then that condition is called diabetes retina damage
in this defect fine cracks develop in surfaces of delicate blood arteries of the retina of eye because of which blood fluid starts leaking out
this fluid produces swelling on the retina of eye because of which there is production of eye defect
this eye defect can occur in various ways like reduction in vision finding difficulty in identifying colors distorted appearance of shape
there is adverse effect on retina of eye because of diabetic retinopathy which is of two types
non proliferative diabetic retinopathy
in this condition because of walls of fine vessels of retina becoming weak they become extended in an irregular manner like thin balloon
it bursts due to weakening of walls because of which blood inside the fine vessels comes out and starts leaking on the retina
blood leaking on the retina itself can become the cause of blindness
in this manner fluid of blood can also leak from weak walls of vessels which can later take form of tough clot
if this secretion gets accumulated on the pupil then it can become the cause of blindness
circulation of fluid stops because of the adverse effect on sensitive vessels of retina of eyes in diabetes
there is destruction of elements of these nerves and they appear as flimsy bunches
that very part of retina becomes inactive in which bunches of this kind form
because of less blood circulation in retina of eye in non proliferative diabetic retinopathy certain augmentation element starts forming because of which creation of new sensitive blood vessels starts
these vessels burst due to weakening and there is coagulation of blood on retina

hyper pigmentation are those spots of dark color on face and other parts of body which reduce the attraction of skin
skin related problem of hyper pigmentation can happen to man or woman anyone
women have to face this problem more due to their delicate skin
this problem is seen more during summer because sunlight is stronger during these days
ultraviolet rays of sun burn the skin because of which spots and blemishes occur on it
in relation to this problem of hyper pigmentation the popular cosmetologist of nature essence sunita arora says the cells of skin are responsible for hyper pigmentation
these cells are called melanocytes
these melanocyte cells produce substance called melanin
problem of hyper pigmentation arises by overstimulation of these melanin cells in some parts of skin
the main cause of hyper pigmentation is burning of skin in strong sunlight
various kinds of hormonal changes occur due to use of fertility and birth control pills
hormonal change makes the skin more sensitive to sunlight
hyper pigmentation can occur because of this
similarly many times complaint of hyper pigmentation can also occur due to medicines like aminodaron mainosaiclin tetracycline and blamaisin saiclafosfemaid
hyper pigmentation that occurs due to change in hormones can heal on its own after pregnancy is over
but many times its treatment becomes necessary
there are two ways of treatment of hyper pigmentation
in the first method there is use of bleaching agent on skin
this bleaching agent neither bleaches the skin nor does it lighten the complexion of skin
in fact it stops the excessive production of melanin
this method of hyper pigmentation is very effective
bleaching agent ends the root cause of disease
now such essential oils have come that are helpful in rectifying the problem of pigmentation
regular use of essential oil gives better results
under the other ways of treatment such products are use that lighten the complexion of problematic skin
most products of this kind are sunscreen creams based on hydroquinone
by this treatment problem of to women gets fixed
while using sunscreen keep this in mind that the cream you are using should be of high quality
by use of bad cream the effect of ultraviolet rays on skin increases rapidly
due to which danger of skin cancer increases
there is saying that prevention is better than cure
to prevent hyper pigmentation maintain caution somewhat this way
since main cause of hyper pigmentation is strong sunlight hence save yourself from the sun
use an umbrella while going out of house
apply an mask of fuller earth on skin and other open parts twice week
splash your face and eyes with water after coming from outside and clean your face and arms with cleansing milk or the most effective homemade cleanser bran
apply juice of cucumber on face you will get relief
if you have to get out in the sun then definitely apply sunscreen of good company on your face and other exposed parts of your body
when the complaint of hyper pigmentation starts get it treated only then
also try to find out if this problem is not because of the hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy
do not take the spots and freckles appearing on your body lightly consult skin specialist as soon as there is such problem
use herbal products
always use cosmetics of good quality
if you have skin related problems then wear cotton clothes with full sleeves
by this the rays of sun will not be able to cause harm to you
while going out in the sun do not forget to wear sunglasses
pay special attention to you diet
on occurrence of complaint of pigmentation do not include many fried things in your diet
eat fresh fruits and fruit juice
there are many ways of maintaining the beauty of skin you will just have to make an effort
if you do not want to become mother then there many kinds of contraceptives in the market
result is that life of women is now under their control
now they have more faith in themselves
this time there is information of various kinds of contraceptives for you
contraceptives are of two kinds
one temporary and the other permanent
use of temporary contraceptive can be stopped anytime
but it is not so with permanent
those days are gone when women were dependent on men for family planning
here for few years lot of awareness has come amongst women regarding family planning
or you can say that due to arrival of many kinds of contraceptives for women selfconfidence has developed in them and they have started feeling themselves as free
whether they want to be pregnant or not is their decision but women are in confusion due to arrival of many kinds of contraceptives
they feel which method should be adopted what are the side effects of method which have what benefits and which contraceptive is good for what age
normally to years of age is such an age group in women in which they can get pregnant
it can happen before fifteen years of age in some cases and also after years of age
hence woman should get cautious as soon as she comes in this age group
the woman who knows about the means of birth control properly only she can balance her life
before knowledge of means of birth control it is very important to have knowledge of your body
there are two ovaries in woman body
every month there is formation of an egg in them
if that day there is union of egg with the sperm of male then the woman will get pregnant
therapists agree that this happens around the fourteenth day
hence those days if woman uses the means of birth control or does not have sex with man then she will not get pregnant
there are many ways for this
temporary birth control means that you can conceive stopping the use of birth control whenever you want
you can never conceive again by permanent birth control
one uses the birth control pills from the fifth day after the beginning of menstruation
the most appropriate time for taking the birth control pills is the night time
birth control pills should be taken with milk before going to bed
here you are being told of the temporary birth control
natural method is that one in which after finding out the unsafe day one keeps away from sex on those days
while continuing the activity of sex the man should ejaculate outside
there are two ways of detecting the unsafe days
first is that one should not have sex around the fourteenth day
how to find out about the unsafe days around the fourteenth day
if your menstrual cycle is of days meaning if your periods have started on the first date then we would consider time from eleventh to twentieth day as unsafe
birth control pills are known by the name of oral contraceptive
the use of these pills is for those women who are unmarried who do not have any child or they do not want child soon after the wedding
other than this those women to whom copper does not suit
it is good for women from to years of age to take this pill but only after clinical examination
these pills are of three kinds
one is those in which there are synthetic hormones named estrogen and progesterone
in the other kind of pills there is only progesterone
it is for those women who are breastfeeding their children
third kind of pills are those in which there are no hormones like saheli
some contraceptive pills are available in pack of pills like ovral novelon femilon etc and some in packs of pills like mala mala
seven pills in pack of pills are those of iron and multivitamin
if you forget someday then take it when you remember the next day or take two pills together
keep in mind if you forget too many times then these pills not do their work
this way these pills provide protection from conception
you should definitely keep getting clinically examined from time to time
by taking birth control pills periods become regular
pain and bleeding during period lessens and there is prevention of anemia
there is also prevention of breast tumor ectopic pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis
other than this you get safe from the day you start taking pills
sometimes there is spotting from time to time head reels for some time or the menstrual month is very less
fungus infection occurs
nausea vomiting etc these symptoms occur in the beginning on taking medicine
therefore doctor asks to take pills at night
headache and depression also occurs in many women
but if you take pills with doctor advice then it is possible to prevent these kinds of side effects
intero uterine contraceptive device lrb iud rrb is known as copper in common language
befitting the name it is in the form of small on which there is copper
it is fitted inside the uterus by the doctor
it is painless and bloodless activity of only two minutes
it is an easy and reliable method of birth control
the success of copper is
one uses it to give gap after the first child between the second child
whenever there is desire to conceive you can get it out easily
to apply this physician calls the desiring women immediately after menstruation only when there has been no relationship of woman man and there has been no conception
but at that woman should not have infection in her reproductive parts
after fitting copper during menstruation woman can feel the thread by inserting two fingers in her vagina
you are not to pull this thread
if there is no pain or pricking sensation then its alright
one month after applying copper after three months you should do clinical examination
if you are having excessive pain in abdomen there is much burning and itching then you should show it to the physician immediately
the duration of copper is of years but certain such multiload copper ts have become available in india which remain alright for five to ten years
other than this copper has also come which comprises medicine and is for those women who have problem of excessive bleeding
it works as contraceptive also and problem of bleeding also gets cured
there is no specific side effect of copper but it does not protect from sexual infections
when is use of birth control not right
if woman gets temperature while taking birth control pills or pain in teeth
if due to some reason she is taking antibiotic she gets diarrhoea so the efficiency of these pills reduces in such state
hence in these conditions she should use other birth control methods like condom
those women who have diabetes heart or liver problem should not take these pills at all
these pills also should not be taken at all on there being high blood pressure thyroid bleeding disorder etc
women infected with epilepsy and tb also should not take birth control pills
similarly those women should not apply copper who are unmarried and who do not have single child
those who have diabetes also should not fit copper
there is one way of not allowing the sperm inside condom
it is known by the name of nirodh
condom is used by men
but if it is used properly then it provides protection up to
men should pull it on their erect penis carefully and keep it loose at the tip so that semen can accumulate there
if you do not leave it loose at the tip then condom will tear during ejaculation and semen can enter the vagina
for complete protection woman should keep vaginal tablet inside her vagina
it is possible to prevent and other sexually transmitted diseases using condom
vaginal tablet is good method of birth control for women
if used the right way vaginal tablet provides to protection
this vaginal tablet is available by the name of today
only woman makes use of vaginal tablet today
the advantage of it is that it is in the woman hands to use it when she wants to
there are no side effects of vaginal tablet
contraceptive injectable are of two types
if women decide to adopt this method then have to go to the doctor to get depo injection
you get depo injection for three months
you get the injection that is for five years under the skin
by applying injection of three months menstruation stops
you have to get at an interval of every three months
this injection does not provide protection from sexually transmitted infections
there can be problems like headache heaviness in breasts nausea disinterest in sex
if ever because of some reason there is unprotected sex or occurrence of incidence like rape then you can prevent conception by using emergency contraception
in this physician asks to eat two pills at an interval of twelve hours
but this should not be used in routine
someday situation also comes when you feel like you can not prevent unwanted pregnancy
this is when emergency pills come useful
in most families of indian society the popular methods of family planning are adopted less even today
even if adopted the responsibility comes around and falls on the woman head only
either she gets sterilisation or takes aid of copper else pills but men often avoid sterilisation or use of condom
as far as the question of contraceptives related to women is concerned they also have their advantages and disadvantages
there is chance of infection by copper in woman genitals
they advise those women who do not have any child or have only one child and want another child in future to avoid it
similarly taking pills also has its own difficulties
illiterates far from it even educated women forget to take them regularly
they also have side effects which can effect adversely on the bodies of women
perhaps this is the reason that despite running family planning programs on the both the levels of government as well as non government even today women become unwanted mothers in large number
according to report of national health survey even today of conceptions in india are unplanned
in this also conceptions are such when husband wife or woman does not want child but conceive
it is the result of this unplanned and unwanted conception that lakh abortions out of the about one crore abortions occurring in the country are of one own will
this is reality that during abortion or because of complications borne out of it women have to lose their lives
today such contraceptive is desperately required that can save women from unplanned or unwanted lrb especially in condition of rape rrb pregnancies
anyhow popular contraceptives do not give women hundred percent guarantee of not conceiving
condom tears during use lrb rate of success rrb then on slightest irregularity in taking pills undoes all that was done
natural contraception lrb based on the counting of menstrual cycle rrb is also in the same condition
most of the women do nt even remember the date they had their last menstrual period
they do nt even know which days of the menstrual cycle are safe from the point of view of not conceiving
in such case emergency contraceptives prove very useful for women
you can take these emergency pills within three to five days on having fear of conceiving after having physical relationship
their success rate is up to percent
if any woman feels that there was mistake of some kind during physical intercourse and since she does not want child then she can use these
emergency contraceptives are of two kinds one steroid hormone pills and second copper releasing intrauterine device
in steroid hormone pills high dose pills come of estrogen in combination of estrogen progesterone and of only progesterone
sterilisation meaning getting freedom from pregnancy forever
sterilisation is also one of the popular methods of family planning
from both man and woman anyone can get it done
sterilisation is permanent and safe measure for birth control
before doing it you should mull over it properly that now you do nt want children ahead
after having sterilisation opening it is quite difficult and expensive process
then there is no hundred percent guarantee of its opening
for sterilisation of man opening his testicles bit both tubes located there are closed so that they are unable to take sperms from testicles
this way sperms stop coming in the semen of the man and the woman is unable to conceive
for semen to be completely sperm free it takes time of three months
after that not finding sperms in semen test they can have sexual intercourse being carefree
vasectomy is very simple procedure and you do nt even need to make man unconscious for it
this procedure gets over in only minutes after numbing the local area and man can go home after minutes
he has to get his check up after rest of two days
then he can live his life like normal days
he can even ride his bike week after sterilisation
which men can get vasectomy
such men who have crossed years of age
are mentally healthy
who have at least one child above the age of one year
when can women get sterilisation
they can get it anytime after getting healthy
hours after having normal delivery
you can get sterilisation simultaneously on having caesarean delivery
but you can get sterilisation by telescope only six weeks after having delivery be it normal or caesarean
you can get sterilisation three months after abortion
for sterilisation of woman you either cut part of her fallopian tube or you tie it via ring or clip
you call this sterilisation tubectomy method
in another method laparoscopic sterilisation woman tubes are only tied by ring or clip seeing through telescope

there is exertion of so much pressure by intoxicating fluids on digestion that no energy remains in the body for any other job
due to pressure on the brain of gas of fermentation formed during digestion there is strain on it
if the child born by conception during intoxication is not stillborn then symptoms of madness appear in him her at later time
on increase of stress of foreign fluid its particular effect is on abdominal nerves and spinal and idavat nerve which is the main cause of psychological disorder
as the fever remains internal disease reaches chronic state and in the end appears in the form of psychological disease
on expulsion of foreign fluid due to an acute disease psychological disease also disappears from time to time but on increase of stress it appears again
as mentioned there are following benefits of sleep

how and when to use water
if an individual upturns lot of water in his stomach six to eight times in one meal then he would dissolve his gastric juice in such way that it will not remain capable of doing its job as digestive juice
this way he will not only fill his stomach with six or eight layers but will also give it distress
in this condition if his stomach moans with pain his digestion is bad like it happens before then how can he complain
then how should you do the regulation of water intake
if you realize thirst before having meal then surely drink
thirst informs of necessity of fluid in body
other than this gastric juice is thick which keeps needing dissolution
do not drink water at all while having meal
even if you drink water drink very less in which impure gastric juice enters all food substances even in the last morsel properly
if after having your meal on lapse of long time if the mixture of food substances again demands some fluid to assist stomach in digestion
in other words if after or hours you feel thirst then you can drink but in moderation
whenever you feel thirst drink water but the amount should not be much
the body especially the stomach has an expectation of fluid substance for mixing and increasing the gastric juice and for bringing in its control all the solid substances from time to time
when neglected it keeps informing of it by itself
sometimes this desire for water knocks slowly and sometimes it screams and calls loudly in the form of extreme thirst
water taken in small amount is immediately accepted by the gastric juice and gets mixed in it easily
its frequency occurring every half an hour provides with more fluid
it removes all immobility and constipation bringing cooling and softening and dissolving while flowing through the body and intestines ordinarily
you should drink half pound of cold water as soon as you wake up in the morning
if the water is kept in brass utensil it will be more beneficial

the family planning program was started in the country from
its aim was only to plan the population
afterwards for the attainment of the missions of the program it started being used for mass education and propaganda
in the decade of seventies by stressing on vasectomy extreme strictness was done in the achievement of goals
as result opposition was produced among masses towards family planning program
during the seventh plan year in place of the family planning program the program was given the identity of family welfare
in this special emphasis was given on the health related needs of women of reproductive age and children of less than five years
in pervasive vaccination was started
in pervasive vaccination the aim was fixed to bring down the death rate and sickness of young children from such diseases whose prevention is possible through vaccines
thereafter by looking at the benefits of this program in the decade of nineties child safety and safe motherhood lrb rrb was prepared and implemented from
in the present times all the family welfare services continuing from before were kept implemented
in it reproductive health youth health sex generated disease infection of reproductive system and aids were included
it was given the name of reproduction and child health
reproduction and child health program was implemented in the region
in the place of goal oriented method from the year community needs are ascertained on the basis of assessment policy
the work plan of health workers only would be the base of all the plans
after unifying the plans created on the sub centres it would be given the form of district work plan
the district work plans together would take the form of state work plan
in order to supply the goods to state the national plan would be based on the state work plan
the partner plan is the form of proposal
the principle essay of the ninth plan published by the planning commission has been written
it is written in it that the government investment during the eighth plan for family welfare is reducing
the extra expenditure of the eighth plan has also been less than that of the seventh plan
this situation looks even more unsatisfactory
at every level there is need of upliftment of health care system
the health care program should be made to reach to more and more people
so that at the end the national goal may be achieved
however because of the economic development spread of education literacy and due to the rights given to the citizens there has been constant improvement in the program in the past years
in the states with less execution many problems are present in relation to weak implementation because of the women not receiving enough rights and education literacy
under the reproduction and health program the solution to these problems would be achieved through the following strategy
giving importance to community participation in planning and services
adopting consumer centric arrangement in services
arrangement of high standard services and better training
removal of contraceptive goal and encouragement
making the services gender sensitive
adoption of multidimensional methods in the implementation and monitoring of services
under the child safety and safe motherhood lrb rrb plan in the unification process of the programs one more step was taken in
in the population and development conference in the country of egypt the proposal for the unification of reproduction and child health lrb rrb programs were tabled
in the reproduction and child health policy it has been emphasized on this thing that people should have the power to control reproductive force
women may be able to get safe conception
couple should be able to keep sexual relation without the fear of conception or disease
accordingly the mission of the ninth plan was kept that all the related programs of eighth plan would be unified
the goal of reproduction and child health lrb rrb conceptualization is that according to the requirement decided by them high standard reproduction and child health
reproductive and child health lrb rrb is unified program
in this apart from other things the support of the organizations of indian government and the support of external international organization of world bank and european commission etc are included
it is the right of the citizens that good quality of reproductive and health services are available to them
therefore the mission of reproductive and child health program is to make available services of good quality
so that for the citizens reliable reproduction and health can be ensured
in this program the quality of the services have been clarified
the quality of the services is that only which we want for our family
the reproduction and child health program is completely centrally funded five year project

under the reproduction and child health program the deputation of male and female doctors is being done after special training
for the facility of tests on these units the facility of lab technician and essential instruments is being made available
for holistic working of maternal and child welfare services sub centres are being constructed

this work is being executed in civil centres through the medium of district literacy committee
in the rural areas sub projects are being run
in the sub project the reproduction and child health program is being implemented in extensive form
urban project is to be done in the six metropolitans of the country
in order to make the workers laboring poor families living in the slums of lucknow kanpur allahabad varanasi agra and meerut benefit from health urban project is going to be started very soon by the indian government

along with quick registration in pregnancy the use of iron folic acid are ensured for protection against and treatment of anemia
in order to save pregnant women from tetanus two vaccines are given at the interval of one month
in the pregnancy the difficulties are identified and accounted
if complications arise in delivery then immediately she should be sent to such unit where the diagnosis and treatment of complications is possible
it is essential that the care of woman post delivery is taken by female health worker
if post delivery complications arise then the woman should be referred to the proper health unit
the meaning of anemia is deficiency of blood in the body
maximum women are affected by anemia in india
in the blood of anaemic women there occurs the deficiency of iron and folic acid
because of which the quantity of hemoglobin gets reduced in their blood
in normal male and female the quantity of hemoglobin in blood should be and respectively
in pregnant women this level is generally found less
the detection of anemia in pregnant women is generally through some of these symptoms
due to anemia there is feeling of weakness in normal days
pregnant woman suffering from malaria may suffer from anemia
because of anemia the symptoms of the paleness of face dark circles under the eyes paleness of nails whitening of tongue vomiting swelling in feet loss of appetite headache etc are found
among the anaemic patients in india the number of pregnant women is the maximum
in normal condition on the occurrence of anemia the immune capacity of the body reduces
there is fatigue and weakness in this but during pregnancy on the occurrence of anemia this becomes harmful for the woman as well as her prospective child
anemia is the chief reason for maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate
due to anemia the weight of the new born baby may become very less than normal
the new born baby may be born handicapped physically or mentally
in anaemic women the milk is also not produced enough for the child
the prevention and treatment of anemia
anemia chiefly occurs due to the reason of deficiency of iron elements in the food materials
the requirement of iron elements in pregnant women is more than normal
therefore such substances in which there is more iron like vegetables salad jaggery etc should definitely be included in food
in pregnant women whose level of hemoglobin in blood is from they have the requirement of treatment with caution in the care of the doctor itself
one pill of iron should be given daily to pregnant woman for three months from three months after getting pregnant
if the woman is pregnant before pregnancy then two pills of iron lrb one morning one evening rrb should be given to her for days
new born baby keeps getting iron in sufficient quantity from mother milk
if any child is anaemic then normally it should be given one pill of iron daily after the age of months
one chief reason of anemia in women and children is the existence of worms in their body
as for example if there is hookworm in someone stomach then the hookworm drinks millilitre of blood from his body daily
therefore for protection against anemia it is very important to give this advice that women children should wear footwear
for protection against anemia the vegetable etc should be eaten after washing
in order to be safe from anemia keep the nails short and clean so because of which any type of worm does not enter inside their body
for protection against tetanus two vaccines should be put at the interval of one month
first vaccine should be given immediately on the detection of pregnancy
due to this both mother and the child to be born would stay healthy
before delivery at least three tests are extremely important before delivery
pregnancy has been divided in three parts
first three months lrb trimester rrb from the first day of the last menstruation to weeks
second three months lrb trimester rrb weeks to weeks
third three months lrb trimester rrb weeks to weeks
normal pregnancy is from the first day of the last menstruation for up to days
female health worker and maid should take proper care of the new born child
if there are complications in the new born baby then it should be referred to the right unit
for the treatment of diarrhoea of children the solution of should be used by the female health workers
imparting information of to the family is important
for the treatment of pneumonia in children the use of cotrimoxazol should be done
it is important for every health worker to have information about nutrition
health workers should certainly make available information related to the nutrition to each family
it is extremely important for the body to get protein iron folic acid vitamin and iodine in proper quantity
in pregnancy the growth of foetus is possible only when the pregnant woman is healthy and properly fed
therefore during pregnancy the pregnant woman has the requirement of one and half times more food and rest
in food protein milk fish eggs and cereals various types of pulses vegetables peanuts and gram etc should be taken in sufficient quantity
in women especially the pregnant women the use of iron and folic acid should be started quickly
the pregnant women are made to use hundred pills of iron and folic acid for safety and two hundred pills for the sake of treatment
there will not be complete benefit on the use of less pills by pregnant woman
vitamin solution is extremely beneficial for children
five doses of vitamin should be given at the interval of months
due to this the child stays free from various diseases
because of the use of vitamin solution on the occurrence of any disease even the intensity of the disease will not increase
vitamin also protects from blindness
because of the deficiency of vitamin the disease of night blindness occurs
this disease night blindness changes into blindness later on
iodine is an extremely nutritive substance for body
because of the deficiency of vitamin diseases like abortion deafness in children dumbness mental retardation physical handicappedness and goitre may occur
in order to prevent these diseases it is essential that the use of iodine rich salts should be done in each family
for family limitation various contraceptives are available at sub centres
in order to keep proper gap between two children lrb copper rrb is implanted by female health workers
pills which can be eaten and nirodh are also distributed
to couples having two or more children the advice of male or female tubectomy is given
in men the facility of vasectomy is available without incision and stitches for free
the detection of patients of diarrhoea cholera whooping cough diphtheria tetanus polio measles tuberculosis leprosy and malaria should be done
the detection of patients of reproductive system infection sex produced diseases and aids should be done and advice regarding protection and treatment should be given
to keep record of birth and death in the region and informing village panchayat officer
because of cold affecting the child cold fever and cough happens
if the treatment is not done quickly then pneumonia happens to the child
on the occurrence of pneumonia if proper treatment is not done then the death of child may even occur
according to the figures available in the hospital in the ward of children the reason of percent of total infant mortality is pneumonia
therefore information of the status of pneumonia identification of danger treatment and where to refer the complicated cases is very important
in the initial stage domestic treatment and in the situation of seriousness by referring to the right place many children can be saved
many times due to the lack of proper information also the deaths of children occur
the identification of pneumonia and management
when the child has cold and cough both then pneumonia may occur to him
the identification of pneumonia happens due to rapid breathing rate and movement of ribs
with cough rapid breathing rate and movement of ribs
together with above symptoms fever fatigued child difficulty in breathing
the methods of management may be the following
safe and proper medicine is available
the treatment may take place at home by the mother
the child has the need of treatment with cotrimoxazole
there is need to refer the child
while counting the rate of breathing special things should be kept in mind
at the time of the counting of breathing rate the child must be relaxing or sleeping
the child should be crying or in difficulty
for this choose any peaceful place in the clinic
for counting the rate of breathing the lower portion of the chest or back should be completely uncovered
by using the seconds needle in your watch count the breathing rate in one minute
how to identify fast breathing rate
in child of less than two months of age the rate of breathing being per minute or more
in child from to months per minute or more
in the age of to years of age in the condition of pneumonia per minute or more
if the breathing rate is more than the above mentioned levels then count again and finalize your diagnosis
while seeing the movement of ribs keep in mind special things
the meaning of the movement of ribs is that the movement of the lower part of the chest certainly towards inside with breathing
only the soft tissue between the ribs or the upper part of the collar bone goes inside with the breathing of the child
this will not be called the movement of the ribs
the movement of the ribs have been defined in the form of sub costal suction or pull
the movement of ribs in small children is normal thing
the sight if ribs very clearly lrb very deep and easy to see rrb may be the sign of pneumonia
if you are doubtful about the ribs of the child then change the position of the child and check again
if the body of the child is bent from waist then the decision of the speed of the lower part of the chest is doubtful
change the position of the child in such manner that he keeps lying straight in the lap of the mother
despite this if the movement of the ribs is not seen clearly then it should be believed that the ribs are not moving
the movement of the ribs is important only when it moves continuously and is seen clearly
if this is seen only in the unhappy state of the child or while it is taking nutrition and not in the state of rest then believe that there is no rib movement
symptoms of extremely serious pneumonia
the child feeling more sleepy and difficulty in waking up
the noise of throat clearing even when silent
production of sound in the breathing of the child or occurrence of fits
extreme malnutrition to the child
fever or feeling of cold on touching in very small child
according to the rate of breathing treatment may be done at home or at health center
in case of serious pneumonia admit the patient in the hospital
in extreme pneumonia certainly admit the child in such hospital or health center where the facility of oxygen is available
children less than two months of age in whom there is rapid breathing rate they should be treated for serious pneumonia
those children in whom there are symptoms of pneumonia and are malnourished they should be taken to the hospital immediately
in order to escape from the danger of pneumonia inform the mother
keep the new born baby warm
feed only mother milk to the child up to six months
to children older than six months give other substances apart from milk
definitely get the and measles vaccination at the right time
before touching feeding milk and feeding food to children especially new born babies certainly wash the hands
control the fever with the paracetamol tablet
certainly give the right dose of antibiotic to children suffering from pneumonia
counsel the mother repeatedly till the time it is not sure that the mother has understood this matter that it is essential to give special attention to children suffering from pneumonia
if in the feeding of the child the nose is obstructing then for its cleaning lrb reduction of sticky substance rrb use salty water
give more liquid to the child to drink
remove the irritation of the throat and cure the cough through safe treatment
for getting rid of cough lemon honey ginger basil hot water etc domestic treatment should be encouraged
nutritive food and clean water hygiene and vaccination these are the three most important body protectors
protecting your child from several diseases these keep your child healthy
there is deep relation between food and health
with balanced diet balanced health is made
before independence the situation of drought and hunger used to generally arise in our country
today due to the reason of mentionable achievements in the field of agriculture in the past decades the production of cereals vegetables and fruits has increased many times
but unfortunately in the country the rate of population increase has advanced faster than the rate of increase of cereals
the growth of population has happened more in the section of poor people only
due to this some very well off people became unhealthy because of over nutrition
that problem of malnutrition is looming even today in front of the maximum poor population
poverty and lack of purchasing power are chief reasons for malnutrition of large section of population of our country
there are some ill effects of malnutrition
there is deep relation between malnutrition and unhealthiest
because of lack of purchasing power of maximum population of india they are not able to take nutritious food
they stay victims of under nutrition
in such situation they also have to do hard physical labor for their livelihood
due to under nutrition the energy balance lrb negative energy balance rrb of their body reduces
as result their capacity to work reduces
due to undernourishment the disease immune capacity of the body also decreases
due to this unhealthiest increases
malnutrition has very bad effect on reproduction and child health
therefore for reproduction and child health the knowledge of facts related to nutrition is essential
the estimation of the nutrition status of any person is helpful in keeping him healthy
generally this is measured by the condition of the weight of the person age height hemoglobin in blood and other elements
malnutrition only is the health problem reason is not poverty but lack of information
for keeping the child healthy there is need to have enough information to the mother and the family members
large number of children india are left malnourished
while the things of their need is available in the nature itself
for this there is no need of extra money
the need is of the information that what should be the right diet to be given to the children by which the children may stay healthy
the girls should also be given food equal to that of boys
abstain from food like alcohol tobacco excess oil rich food excess chilli and spices excess sugar and salt and excess tea coffee
the foundation of the health of the child starts from the pregnancy itself
the kind of food which the pregnant woman gets the growth of the child also takes place according to it
thus from pregnancy itself it is important for the child to get nutritional food
here the meaning of nutritive is not expensive food but food rich with vitamin protein and iron substances
in what situation the food of the child may be cheap and nutritive
in pregnancy food should be consumed in the right quantity and nutritive
in food eat such things in which iron elements vitamin and iodine are in rich quantity
there is the need of vitamin to the pregnant woman
for eye sight there is the need of vitamin to every woman
because of the deficiency of vitamin night blindness may occur in pregnant woman and mother who has already fed milk lrb who has fed milk to child rrb
if there would be deficiency of vitamin in mother then this deficiency would be there in the child as well
due to this even the eye sight of the child may also go
due to the deficiency of vitamin there is high risk of contracting other infections as well
there should not be the deficiency of vitamin by eating green leafy vegetables like lettuce pot herb mustard cabbage radish gram lentil
the fruits and vegetables of yellow color like mango papaya carrot and gourd are beneficial in removing the deficiency of vitamin
these things are easily available in rural districts
apart from this you can also take curd cheese eggs liver in the food
by giving the child nutritional substance along with breast feeding we make the child healthy and capable of fighting with the infections
after one year if the upper arm of the child is less than then he is malnourished
if it is less than then he is malnourished in the extreme form
there is the requirement of iodine to pregnant women
due to the deficiency of iodine apart from the disease of goitre many other harmful conditions may arise
due to the deficiency of iodine the child may have mental retardation
the child may be miscarried or may be born dead
the child may be deaf or dumb
there could be stiffness like paralysis in the bone of his knee
some quantity of iodine is obtained by us from water and vegetables
due to the reason of environmental pollution we do not get the proper quantity of iodine
always keep the iodine salt in closed vessel not in uncovered vessel
because of coming getting air in uncovered vessel dampness comes in the salt
because of this the iodine mixed in salt does not stay in the proportion to the body
what should be the proper type of food for child
in the life and growth of the child his weight at the time of birth plays very important role
in indian conditions the weight of the child at the time of birth should normally be
the weight of one third of children at the time of birth is found to be less than
in infant mortality rate the number of children less than is found to be maximum
children of less weight are born to mothers suffering from anemia
the quantity of hemoglobin of mother at the time of birth is less than then the weight of the child at the time of birth may be very less
for such women there is need of
the child having less weight at the time of birth depends on the nutritional condition of the mother
the nutritional condition of the mother depends on the financial condition of the mother
the child having less weight at the time of birth are generally related to poor families
on not taking excess protein the face stay swelled decolouring of hair and skin thinning of upper arm flakes on the skin and hands and feet stay swelled
right from the time of birth it is important to give special attention to food for good health of the child
in order to make the child disease free the child must get the first milk of the mother
the child should not be given tonic honey etc
certainly make the child drink mother milk
the milk of mother protects the child from diseases
in the milk of mother there is vitamin and all nutritive elements
in the mother milk there are those nutritive elements which are not found in any milk
mother milk is food and medicine for the child
mother milk is beneficial to the child economically as well
in sickness the child gets help from mother milk in becoming alright
while feeding the child special attention should be given to the child for cleanliness
the child should be fed till the time he does not start asking for food on his own
approximately percent children are of less weight at the time of birth lrb less than kilogram rrb
but within months this rate remains percent
such happens because in all the communities there has been validity of feeding up to six months of birth
the child keeps getting nutritive substance from the milk of the mother
the weight of children of the age group of months and months gets reduced lrb under weight rrb again
its first reason is that starting to give other food materials apart from mother milk long before six months
or else not starting to give any other food materials apart from mother milk even after six months
its second reason is due to the reason of infection increase in the rate of disease lrb morbidity rate rrb
in order to escape from both these problems it is essential that the family members should be given the information about nutrition education
even after six months other food materials should be given together with mother milk
generally nutritive food materials should be given times in day in balanced quantity
for protection against diseases cleanliness especially the purity of the drinking water should be paid attention to
the children of years generally start eating
due to this improvement comes also in children born with less weight
the information of availability of nutritive substances at low price should be given to the families of children of this age group
this information is imparted under various programs like woman and child development department and family welfare programs
the children from to years of age generally come in the group of school going children
they are distributed medical tests and nutritive diet under the mid day meal program and school health program
the children who do not go to school stay devoid of this
in the ninth five year plan the registration of all the children in the school continuation of the mid day program and test of the weight of children and disease should be arranged
in youth the physical and mental growth occur very fast
in youth there is requirement of various nutritive elements
sufficient attention is not given on the nutrition of people of this age group
due to this here maximum become victim of under nutrition
the wealthy section become victim of obesity
due to marriage or conception in young age generally anemia or reduced hemoglobin are found
it ill effect is seen both on the mother and the prospective child
to solve these problems information is imparted trough the media of the programs like health education nutrition education and programme and program
nutritive food is the mantra for good health
the strength to fight against disease is obtained from food
the child of the body also needs this strength
for this the most important are vitamin and iron elements
at least three to four times in week the child should be given vitamin rich food
every second day half bowl of lentils should be fed
due to this there would not be any deficiency of vitamin
deep impact falls on the eyes due to the deficiency of vitamin
to keep check on growth the weight of the children less than six years is also taken in anganbari
apart from this for the growth of children information regarding right upbringing information of vaccination and knowledge of health is also imparted
apart from this here proper education is also given for the mental growth of children
this way it has become clear that for pregnant woman and child there is no need of any such food which is very expensive
in rural districts also the facility of anganbari is available
the girls are also in need of that much of food as the boys
generally it has been seen that in comparison to boys less attention is paid in the upbringing of girls
it is said that later on boys have to earn
the boys will only fulfil the major responsibilities of the house
while apart from the responsibilities of the house the girls have to give birth to children later on
if the girls are weak then post marriage their children will also be weak
if the vicious cycle of early marriage and less birth duration is maintained then the prospective children would be weak
therefore how much important nutritious food is for boys that much it is also for girls
vitamin has high importance for child
new born baby gets vitamin from mother milk
on not getting mother milk night blindness may occur in children
with the vaccination of measles the dose of vitamin is given
the virus of measles and chicken pox affect the stock of vitamin of the body
generally the child does not die of measles or chicken pox but due to infections happening after that like pneumonia dysentery brain fever etc
if pregnant women and their family members are given these informations then definitely mother and child may be protected from becoming the victims of malnutrition
for protecting the child from malnutrition the requirement is not of more money but of right knowledge
there are many forms of malnutrition
by taking excess carbohydrate and not taking protein substance kwashiorkor
marasmus on not getting more food lrb deficiency of everything protein carbohydrate and fat rrb lrb marasmus rrb
those children who do not drink milk or does not consume sunlight lrb vitamin rrb various types of diseases may surround them like rickets
occurrence of many diseases related to skin from malnutrition
swelling and bleeding in gums due to malnutrition
in the past decades in india also many changes have come in the life style of people
due to the facilities at present reduction has come in the physical labor of man
because of this reason the problem of obesity has come up
because of excess food the quantity of many substances start reaching in the blood of man more than normal
due to this diseases like heart disease diabetes etc start occurring
in the society for this section also health education and nutrition education is to be provided
children like chicks should always keep eating something or the other
at least three times in day something or the other should be given to the children to eat
in between meals snacks should be given
children should be given energy rich nutritive substance
breast feeding is complete food
till the time it is possible it should be fed
extra nutritive substance should be given to malnourished children
for easy digestion the food materials should be cooked properly
for making the food material energy rich little bit of oil lrb fat rrb should be added
if you have to keep your child healthy then purchase nutritive substance fruits milk eggs etc
do not buy tea coffee cool drink
under the reproduction and child health program the behavioural aspect and the prevention of diseases related to have been included
many infections in reproductive system infection lrb rrb are produced by bacteria virus and protozoa
this infection occurs in upper and lower part of the reproductive system of male and female body
and occur due to
every is not sex produced disease
there are some general reasons also for reproductive system infection
the infections occurring due to the overgrowth of organs found generally in the reproductive system are called endogenous infection
is the collection of communicable diseases
this is spread by the unsafe sexual relations
such infections which occur due to insufficient medical processes like unsafe abortion unsafe delivery or implant of by unhygienic method
these are called iatrogenic infections
is found in developed and developing countries
the havoc of aids is justified
the infection of is found more in developing countries
its reason are biomedical behavioural and social
maximum of these are in social transition period
with increase of youth population urbanisation is progressing with even less restrictions
because of the discharge of foul smelling liquid from the vagina or in the condition of occurrence of itching pain or inflammation or may occur
in this situation the doctor should be contacted immediately and the tests should be done
for the meaning of plan is that the goals and missions have been clarified
there are two goals of
communicable goals and goal collection
the important element for developing good and effective message
marking the benefit of desired behavioural change
imparting proper rational knowledge in favor of the prospective benefit
to make the message clear not complex
to mark main points
to limit the thoughts in one material
whatever is the type of thought or message it should have that type of emotion
the message and knowledge should be given through reliable sources persons
what is the importance of family planning
for healthy birth it is essential that the mothers who are giving birth to the child are healthy
for the health of mother it is essential that balanced and nutritive food is available to them in required quantity
with this only the health and population policy would be crated
such has been seen that in the second year of conjugal life the married women conceive
there health starts deteriorating gradually
due to this reason only women start becoming the victim of diseases
the effect of all these diseases falls on the yet to be born child
because of financial situation not being good the upbringing of the produced child does not take place correctly
the arrangement of the education of children etc also does happen
because of the reason of population growth poverty unemployment spread
because of the increase of unhealthy sick children the store of below standard man power increases
the main organ of family welfare program is mass health especially mother and child health nutrition environmental health etc
the couples should be provided with the advice of family planning knowledge and services
with this it can keep gap in the number and birth of children desirably
those children who do not get children getting them children after providing them with medical services is also under this program itself
for producing children indeed there is joint partnership of male and female
in the process of child birth the woman only has to face all the difficulties
many methods are available to keep the family limited

after the surgery just like before there is ejaculation only there are no sperms in these
that man whose vasectomy has happened he has no worry that his woman will gat pregnant
there is no need to buy or remember any thing
there are two ways of doing vasectomy in man

aids is lethal disease which is produced by meaning human deficiency virus
at present there are no vaccine or medicines for treatment for cure against this disease
is an acquired infection
the infection is received by man due to his activities from outside
when the person gets infected with this virus once then the virus starts weakening his immunity system
there are many such microbes which stay in body and environment
due to normal immunity system of the body the microbes do not produce any harm to the body
because of the weakening of the immunity system of the person suffering from the opportunist infections make use of the situation
these develop in the form of signals and symptoms meaning syndrome
in india there has been only years of aids
in this very small time this disease has developed in the form of the most serious health problem of the country
this disease has spread rapidly in its nearby areas
in the joint cases of maharashtra tamil nadu and manipur were percent of the total cases of india
percent out of this was reported in the state of maharashtra alone
according to the report the patients of infection and aids are only few thousands
there is huge difference between this figure and actual figure
this infection has reached to the community by those people who keep adventurous behavior
white blood corpuscles are our security warriors who destroy the microbes of diseases
the active virus of aids destroy the white blood corpuscles because of diseases immune capacity is destroyed
out of every women one has it due to which the risk of it getting spread in the new born babies has increased
ill effects have been seen of this situation on the child welfare and safe maternal program started by the government some years back
continuous reduction has come in the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate
in this disease due to the rapid spread in mother and children ill effects can be seen
the reason for the rapid spread of aids is the low level of literacy

by looking after and serving the infected person
by the embrace or kiss of the infected person
by sitting close to infected peron coughing or sneezing
aids does not even spread through blood donation

the reason of not feeding colostrums lrb first milk rrb to the child
colostrums is thrown because people say that it is accumulated stale milk of months this will harm the child
therefore in place of colostrums people give the first diet of tonic milk honey and water powder milk etc
first milk is beneficial to the child but what is the benefit it is not known
to encourage mother so that she starts feeding the child her own milk immediately after birth
what is colostrums
why is it essential to feed colostrums
how should the baby be fed the milk so that the lactation can be fast
the first milk of mother is thick yellow and sticky substance which is called colostrums or first milk
it is essential to give colostrums to the child
immediately after the birth lrb within hour rrb certainly feed it your milk
this thick and yellow milk is the elixir for the child
the natural substances present in it save it from contracting dysentery cold cough etc diseases
in this the vitamin substance beneficial for the child is present in huge quantity
it helps in the expulsion of the black faeces of the child
never understand this that the first secreted milk is bad or indigestible
this is wrong thought on the contrary the substances which are quick to digest are found in more quantity which is suitable for the new born baby
after delivery it comes out for two three days with the milk of the mother
many times the child is not able to suck the breast properly but keep trying it will very quickly
whether milk comes out or not let the baby suck both the breasts certainly for at least half an hour one after the other do such many times the mother will start lactating the very first day
during the breast feeding the full part of areola lrb the dark portion around the nipple rrb should be inside the mouth of the child
when the child will suck the dark part then the mother milk will be secreted fast and will be produced more
giving tonic making honey lick giving the solution of sugar and water to the new born baby are old customs and traditions
doing such is harming the child
do not give cow milk buffalo milk goat milk by mixing with water to the new born baby
this may harm the baby
give to the child only the mother milk
the common symptoms of the deficiency of water in children are increase of thirst lack of tears dryness of lips and tongue becoming restless and irritated drying up of the skin of the body reduction of elasticity in them if pinched then the pinch staying as before etc
the serious symptoms of the deficiency of water in children are the child becoming unconscious deepening of the eyes dryness lack of tears becoming excessive weak deepening of palate excessive reduction or stopping of urine
approximately three fourth of the total weight of the body of children is water
due to the reason of dysentery the water and minerals from the body are lost which is called dehydration
due to loss of water and minerals in excessive quantity even the death of the child can take place
generally due to dysentery the child may become the victim of malnutrition
very less or less urine the color of the urine becomes dark yellow
there is sudden and rapid loss of weight
the mouth becomes dry the eyes become small and tearless
the sign of pinch stays for long in the skin
if the skin does not come in normal state after being pinched then the child is suffering from dehydration
the microbes which cause dysentery harm the intestines of the body
the power of the intestines to digest and absorb the food gets lost or lessened
due to dysentery the food comes out of the intestine without getting digested
due to this reason the intestines do not get time to absorb useful substances in food
due to this reason the child becomes victim of lack of nutrition or malnutrition
malnutrition reduces the diseases immune capacity of the body
malnourished child becomes victim of dysentery and other infectious diseases repeatedly and frequently
this way dysentery from malnutrition and malnutrition from dysentery occurs
with water as well many essential elements are removed from the body due to which malnutrition becomes even more sinister
simple dysentery that is when there is no sign of dehydration then for stopping the expected dehydration treatment can be done by giving domestic liquid items and easily digestible food materials
in dysentery easily digestible things like chhachh salted lassi coconut water lemon water vegetable soup fruit juice shikanji jowar water etc should be given in large quantity
these thing can be given to children younger than two years every time one quarter or half glass and children older than two years every time one glass
to grown up children give khichri dalia mashed vegetables like potato and fruits like papaya and banana rice pulses egg fish and well cooked meat
some fat rich substance and oil may also be given
abstain from fibrous and spicy food materials
harm may also be done by the cool drinks and sweet sherbets of the market
keep strict eye on the imminent dehydration
serious dysentery that is dehydration to some limits
when the signs of dehydration become visible in children then give them life saving solution
life saving solution is diagnostic way of rehydration is simple but effective treatment
this fulfils the loss of water minerals and other nutritive elements produced in the body due to dysentery
generally on the onset of dysentery medicines should not be given
in abnormal situation on the advice of the doctor medicines may be administered
according to the world health organisation the chief elements of life saving solution are glucose anhydrous lrb gram rrb sodium chloride that is common salt lrb gram rrb sodium citrate lrb gram rrb potassium chloride lrb gram rrb
in order to escape from dysentery make use of safe water sources like tube well hand pump tap etc
keep the edible things clean and eat from clean hands only
make use of the toilet
at any cost do not keep the child thirsty in dysentery
on the onset of dysentery do not feed the liquid substance from the bottle
make the liquid drink from clean glass and spoon
keep yours and your child nails short
do not feed the uncovered things of the market
among the ailments being produced due to measles one is dysentery as well
especially dysentery is very dangerous for the children

this child unlike the other healthy children can not bear the disease of dysentery
even the death of child can occur due to this
the pair of measles and dysentery bring the message of death for the small children
the vaccination of measles should certainly be administered with the solution of vitamin between months
by feeding mother milk to the child also the dysentery can be stopped this is natural diet it is clean and hygienic
continue breast feeding while dysentery
by the habit of washing the hands one can be escape from dysentery even
natural treatment has its own properties
cleanliness there is special importance of inner and outer cleanliness in natural medicine
it is even said that the basic reason of disease in body is the accumulation of foreign elements in the body
clean and beautiful personality and place feels good to everyone
therefore the naturopathy doctors should themselves wear clean clothes keep their body clean and keep the hospital microbes free
the wards of patients toilets bathrooms treatment rooms sitting rooms etc should be clean
the surrounding environment should be clean and natural
onset of hiccups is not problem
by the way various experiments related to medicine have proved that hiccups are not any serious disease
generally hiccups come to every person and after some time stop on their own
many times by thinking continuously about hiccups the round of hiccups will start due to psychological reasons
after all what are the causes of hiccups
generally when we start behaving against any normal physical rule then the hiccups start
hiccups may also come by taking food more than required by not chewing the food in sufficient amount by eating hot and spicy food and by drinking very hot tea
apart from this excessive alcoholism tension continuous laughter or crying are the other reasons of hiccups
the patients of the mental disease like hysteria are also victims of hiccups
the gas which is produced on feeding the child that collides with the diaphragm and produces strain in the nerve named phranic nerve
due to this strain also the children start getting hiccups
from the point of view of physical creation the production of hiccups outline the anomaly produced in our respiratory and digestive system
like any other physical abnormality this information as well is transferred to the brain immediately
brain also produces obstruction in the respiratory system of the body due to this spasms occur while taking breath these spasms are basically hiccups
hiccups signify the deficiency of water in the body
generally after taking glass of water the hiccups cease
by the way generally after the passage of some time the hiccups stop on their own
while many times person keeps getting hiccups for several days
objectively sufficient research related to the cause and diagnosis of hiccups is due
for the treatment of simple hiccup drinking water is enough because by drinking water the food particle stuck at the wrong place comes out
some domestic tips have also proved successful in stopping hiccups
by chewing sugar mixed in mint one gets relief from hiccups
many times by licking honey one gets rid of hiccups
by the smell of asafoetida also hiccup stops immediately
immediate benefit can be felt by making the patient smell sea salt mixed in ghee or water
benefit in hiccup is also felt eating boiled rice after adding ghee to it
on the onset of the period of hiccup if some grains of sugar are swallowed then hiccups stop
by pressing fingers in both the ears the hiccups stop
behind this treatment is the upsetting of the proportion of oxygen and carbon dioxide present in the body
whenever the quantity of oxygen will get reduced in the body then veins and muscles will get fatigued and hiccups will stop on their own
actually the easiest way of escaping from hiccups is to show caution in eating habits and maintain the discipline related to food
orange is also medicine
sensitive fruit orange is both sour and sweet
nagpur city of india is known especially for oranges

gandhiji wanted to change this awful situation therefore he established nisargopachaar in uruli
but today the educated and civilized man has kept himself deprived of the health giving power of the nature in the hope of one own consumerism
leaving the natural life of the villages man created big cities and with it gave rise to various diseases
man must not have even imagined the artificial effort done for physical comfort will become the reason of physical diseases
together with unnatural life style the diet related artificiality has also increased
in the villages established in the lap of nature and far from the wind of modern civilization man can consume the above mentioned five elements with freedom
there he has no restriction but at present in villages also lack of healthy life is visible due to uneducation and addiction
here in the small big cities due to dense population the air the after the soil get polluted
in the big cities maximum people have to stay deprived of the disease destroying and life giving rays of the sun
the consumption of open sky is difficult
due to the habit of unnatural life for long time they are not able to bear even the open air sunlight and water of changing weather
the power of nature consumption is not left in them
for this they will have to acquire the habit
the symptoms of cold by slightly cold air body pain on getting wet in the rain fever by walking in the sun become visible in them
their disease immunity power gets weakened
the people who spend life by taking good nutritious food also can not stay disease free
but comparatively the person taking less nutritious food can also stay disease free by taking five elements in pepper quantity
together with balanced diet the five major elements can not be undermined
like the vegetation the man also needs to consume the five elements and to extract complete nutrition from air water food etc and for the body purification

alzheimer is one such disease or state of brain in which continuously nerve cells or the cells of brain keep dying gradually
due to the destruction of the cells of brain the work related to memory changes come in them
due to the destruction of the cells of brain alterations come in the behavior and memory
in maximum cases the disease of alzheimer starts showing its impact after middle age
but it has also come to be seen that alzheimer also affects people from to years of age
alzheimer disease has also been seen on hereditary levels
mainly three stages have been seen of alzheimer
first stage loss of memory delusion reduction of judgement loss of interest towards things or people repeated forgetfulness difficulties in daily life irritation etc
second stage restlessness during evening time increase of delusion weakening of memory even more not feeling the sensation of heat and cold loss of control on excretion repeating the words several times anger quarrelling becoming obstinate loss of hair
third stage speaking words with difficulty not recognizing family members friends and close relatives complete dependence on others absolute no control on excretion increase of sleep disorders incompetence of getting up and sitting comma at the end
why does the disease of alzheimer occur its absolutely correct cause has not yet been known
although some dangerous chromosomes of alzheimer have certainly been known
the danger of increase of the disease of alzheimer increases with age
for example if any person in the family has alzheimer then his blood relatives can also be at that much big risk
due to hereditary reasons alzheimer generally shows its impact in the age of years
for the treatment of alzheimer or to be saved from it improvement in blood circulation can be an effective medical treatment
such medicines are available by which the loss in the mental capacity can be lessened

the disease of alzheimer can be pushed little more back by antioxidant vitamin and good diet
if people be careful in the beginning then one can be safe against alzheimer disease
for body the main source of energy is carbohydrate
in maximum food materials there is carbohydrate which the body changes into sugar
for doing any work we get energy from carbohydrate alone
in food materials two types of carbohydrates are found simple and complex
simple carbohydrate is found in white sugar fruits and milk
therefore the consumption of fruits and milk should be done
because in this there are nutrients like vitamin fiber and calcium which are not available in simple sugar
complex carbohydrate is also called starch
in complex carbohydrate maida white bread white rice pastries pasta and junk food etc are included
consume complex carbohydrate rich substances less because these substances digest late and produce the complications of constipation etc
due to substances rich in complex carbohydrate the problems of pimples etc are produced
instead of low carbohydrate consume good carbons like whole cereals pulses fruits vegetables and sauce
on the occurrence of fungal infection you must have seen many people applying henna

if there is fever then apply the paste of henna in palms fever will lower fast
in new study it has been found that during pregnancy the chances of the children suffering from asthma is more forwomen who stay tensed
according to the researchers of bristol university if during pregnancy the women are treated for tension then the cases of asthma can be stopped from increasing
in britain lac children and lac adults are suffering from patient
according to the chief researcher professor john handerson due to tension only many types of hormones get secreted in our body whose effect is seen on the child and its immune system during pregnancy which spreads in the form of disease like asthma in future
in this study thousand children of families were included
the researchers had asked questions even to the mothers of these children
whenever person is ill then he knows that which medicine he has to take and how much to take
it is also important for him to know that when it is beneficial for him to take the medicine
if the disease is in the lower part of the body then the consumption of medicine before the meal is beneficial
if the body is to be thinned then the medicine should be taken before meal
in the ailments of stomach abnormalities of bile the use of medicine should be done in the middle of the meal
strong people should generally take the medicine empty stomach
for the upper parts of the body the medicine should be taken after the meal
medicines for cough produced ailments and to make the body fat should be taken after the meal
boys girls fragile and those hating the medicine should take it with the meal
in respiratory diseases cough intense thirst vomiting and poison related diseases the instruction is to take the medicine little after meal
in diseases of ear nose throat and eyes it is beneficial to take the medicine before going to sleep at night
weak and people observing fast should abstain from medicine
the consumption of medicines which are repulsive and of intense smell can also be used before meal
children actually jump around enough the entire day then why do they need to exercise
if you also think such and do not inspire your child for exercise then in one way you are compromising with his growth
the university of illinois did study on the physical education and exercise in children and discovered its multiple benefits
it was found in the study that positive influence can be seen on the study of the physical education class exercise program in recess time and after school
the study done by professor of community health charles hillman says that physical education enhances the ability of the student to concentrate
prof hillman said the aim of this study was to know whether light exercise like walk can even have good impact on the health of child
during the research the study was done on three bases
during this positive link was seen between physical activity concentration and academic achievement
in the study girls and boys of years participated
in order to know there control power many stimulus tests were done
in the research it was seen that children who walked everyday did the test in better way
so far that even to complete difficult challenge these students did less mistakes
it was also seen that even in the midst of noisy environment these students were able to do the work with more concentration
because of all this much improvement was seen in the reading spelling and maths
mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern lifestyle may also become the cause of the spread of disease
here in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of washi situated mgm hospital this fact has come up
in the study the phones of more than percent of the workers of the hospital have been found to be the carriers of the microbes and spores of contagious diseases
by this there is chance of the occurrence of skin disease food poisoning acne blisters toxic shock syndrome and other diseases
in this study done by the indian medical research council mobile phones of the workers were tested
the researcher dr nikhil tambe final year student of mgm hospital found that bacteria and spores were found on phones out of them
this bacteria together with making the disease of the patient serious also become the cause of the delay of the cure
tambe said that the presence of the maximum number of bacteria were found in the phones of the technicians
after this the mobile phones of ward boy nurse and then doctors were found infected serially
dr chitra pai chief of the microbiology department of the hospital said that on the mobile phones maximum percent staphylococcus accrues bacteria were found
this microbe can become the cause of skin disease
apart from this in mobile phones microbes like coli and pseudomonas were also found
due to the infection of coli and pseudomonas microbes maximum ill effect is seen on the health
two years back in study done in coiambatore the presence of percent microbes was found on the phones of hospital workers
first let me tell you as to what are antioxidants
as our age passes some or the other type of loss occurs in our body
we generally see that some people appear old before age while some appear comparitively young even at the age of years
the answer to this is with modern medical science and this answer is the deficiency of antioxidant in our food
all around us there is pollution tensile environment and many among us smoke cigarette actively
all this speed up the process of destruction in body after uniting
even the diseases of the heart to great extent can be due to this destructive process
just like the rust on the iron exposed in air lrb which occurs due to oxidation rrb the cause of the destruction in the body is also oxygen and tissues the chemical reaction of the enzymes
the accumulated fat in the arteries of the heart lrb cholesterol rrb gets oxidised before getting accumulated
antioxidants are micronutrient substances which stop the destruction occurring in the tissues and organs of the body
therefore these have immense capacity to keep the disease of the heart at bay and for its treatment lrb reversal rrb
along with antioxidants there are other substances as well which are essential to make the food complete which help our heart and other organs and make our body healthy and increase the immune capacity of our body
this collection of the information of heart throw light on these food making it complete
this is the wonder food of future antioxidants
in continuous fast life generally man is left devoid of nutrition or else stays dependent on diet consisting of less nutrition
in this relation can we think something for ourselves or our family instead
this is that portion of knowledge related to nutrition which has been specially created for us
every capsule of this knowledge give us information about vitamins and minerals which are important for our health
what are free radicals
in what way do these harm human body
in what way vitamin and other antioxidant nutritive substances protect the body from the destruction of free radicals
we will try to give answers to these questions and will tell that fruits and vegetables rich in types of antioxidants may be beneficial for your health
for the knowledge of this thing that how free radicals and antioxidants react with each other little bit of knowledge is essential in the subject of tissues and molecules
physiology for the revision of chemistry brief chapters have been given here
human body is made up of various types tissues and tissues are made up of various types of molecules
in molecules there may be one or more atoms which remain tied due to chemical bond
in atom there are nucleus neutron proton and electron
electrons participate in chemical reactions and keep the atom tied in the form of molecule
electron keeps the atom surrounded in one or many shells
certainly oxygen element is extremely important for life but in some conditions it is even harmful for human body
due to the reactivity of oxygen many harmful compounds are formed
these are called the compounds of reactive oxygen species
reactive oxygen compound give oxygen to other substances according to their own nature
many out of these reactive species are free radicals and consist of one or more extra electron
this way because of the lack of similar compounds it is the cause of instability and extreme reactivity
oxygen atom is the cause of the reason of ageing heart disease stiffening of the artery the reason of loss of immune capacity damage of free radicals
due to these losses the conditions of stiffness of the arteries diabetes cataract and premature agreeing arise
the contribution of antioxidant is extremely effective in the prevention of cancer heart disease alzheimer disease rheumatism and cataract
together with different oxidants these work in different cellular compartments
the system of enzyme is an important aspect of immunity capacity glutathione peroxidise superoxide dismutase and catalase etc which reduce the accumulation of some harmful oxidants in the tissues
some essential minerals are selenium copper manganese and zinc etc are essential for the production of the activity of the live enzymes
another security line of the immune capacity of the body towards the harm of the free radicals is the presence of antioxidants
antioxidants is molecule which is at least so stable that they can give one electron to free radicals and make them inert so that their capacity to harm is lessened
some antioxidants of this type are antioxidants glutatione ubiquinol and uric acid which are produced during the normal metabolism of the body
though till now around antioxidants have been detected
the most popular antioxidants are vitamin vitamin and carotenoids
tissues of oxygen free radicals lrb oxygen free radicals rrb are produced during digestion
these poisonous molecules of tissues are produced in the body due to the cause of the light of the sun ray radiation food tobacco or the smoke of car and other pollutants of the atmosphere
in fact these free radicals harm dna that is the ones providing hereditary characteristics
microbes convert chemical compounds and at times completely destroy the tissues
with the help of antioxidants the compensation of this damage can be done
in which way can the antioxidants protect from the harm occurring due to the frss radicals
the ones providing immunity are the antioxidants substances
as it is clear from the name antioxidants are those substances which stop the destruction occurring in the body and normalise the oxidation process occurring in the tissues of the organisms
these nutritive substance lrb vitamin and mineral rrb are enzymes lrb the supportive protein in the chemical reactions situated in the body rrb
it is believed that these protect from the ill effects of the free radicals
by donating their personal electron the antioxidants depress the process of stealing electron by the free radicals
after shunning the electron also they do not become free radical because in themselves they have stability
antioxidants stop the process of oxidation by deactivating the free radicals
in doing such the oxidation of them takes place
therefore the sources of antioxidants have to be maintained uninterrupted
though you take multivitamin regularly consume extra vitamin many types of fruits vegetables then also it is not essential that you are getting sufficient antioxidant
with respect to these nutritive substances fighting cancer health enhancer specialists have given opinion
here such substances are being named which should be taken in daily breakfast
among the antioxidants given daily there are vitamin vitamin and selenium
vitamin is found in two types tocopherol and trocotreinol
if you are taking any vitamin then it would be tocopherol because at present tocopherol is under research
what does tocopherol do
tocopherol protects from heart disease stroke alzheimer disease and cancer
the immune capacity also increases with tocopherol
trocotreinol fights against heart disease breast cancer it also protects the skin from ultraviolet radiations
where is tocopherol found
in less quantity tocopherol is found in almonds and vegetable oils
trocotreinol is found in the husk of rice
for therapeutic dose the need for other complementary substances arises
the dose of natural vitamin has been suggested in the form of to of mixed tocopherol
what does selenium do
selenium protects from cancer heart disease cataract muscular degeneration and is supportive in the function of other antioxidant
where is selenium found
selenium is found in brazil nut cereal vegetables and its quantity various according to the regional soil
in the suggested dose to mcg of selenium with food or even without food daily
do not take selenium in large quantity otherwise poisoning may occur
start taking antioxidants after the age of forty years
if before the age of years you have to take many pills then you should not take coenzyme alpha lpoic acid
coenzyme fights against cancer and heart disease
coenzyme makes the gums strong protects nerves is helpful in energy production
where is coenzyme is found
coenzyme is present in each tissue of body specially in heart
coenzyme is also found in almonds and oils but for medicinal dose extra quantity may be needed to be consumed
in the suggested dose with daily food mg of coenzyme specially is important for heart patients
what does alpha lipoic acid does
alpha lipoic acid protects from the nerve damage related to heart disease cancer cataract stroke diabetes
alpha lipoic acid increases the level of glutathione
where is alpha lipoic acid found
in some food substances very little quantity of alpha lipoic acid is found lrb example lettuce meat potato etc rrb
in the suggested dose mg quantity of alpha lipoic acid with food mg everyday can be taken by people suffering with diabetes
what is the sufficient quantity of nutritive substances
in american food and nutrition board decided the quantity of various types of nutritive substances after guessing the quantity of nutritive substances the protection of body through nutritive substances through figures after studying the scientific history
for each type of nutritive substance the board has decided recommended dietary allowance lrb rda rrb which is diet for healthy people which the body can easily accept
tolerable upper intake level lrb ul rrb is that quantity of nutritive substance which healthy person can consume everyday without any harm
only in some cases the board could not decide yet that how much quantity of nutritive substance would be beneficial or harmful
how to choose antioxidants for fighting the diseases
whenever you buy fruits and vegetables keep in mind that you choose only those whose color is bright
as much bright the color of the fruits and vegetables that much more would be the antioxidants

but the patient of the dieses of dementia starts forgetting more than required and losses the ability to remember again
in dementia the person is forced to behave like children
the child though with age develops his mental capabilities but the condition of the patient suffering with the disease of dementia becomes serious with increase in age
there are two reasons for the dementia disease
the first reason is the contraction of brain
this happens due to the disease named alzheimer
in alzheimer due to the death of the cells of brain the size of the brain starts decreasing
together with this the chemical named acetilcolinesterase also starts decreasing in brain
the second reason is the accumulation of the clots in the transmitters of blood providing nutrition to brain
in india among all the reasons of dementia this is major reason
the symptoms of the disease do dementia are as follows
lack of memory difficulty in remembering new things
arising of problems in remembering date telephone number and the account of money
gradually forgetting old things
in dementia produced due to the disease named alzheimer the loss of memory takes place very slowly about which many times for up to several years there is no knowledge
loss in the awareness of place and time for example considering morning as evening to start using kitchen as bathroom forgetting the way to home etc
forgetting the names of things found nearby like on showing the spectacles not able to say what it is
purchasing unnecessary things from market
changes in personality like staying silent more than required or else the growth of very irritable or doubting nature
such symptoms are seen in percent patients of dementia
repeating one thing repeatedly talking nonsense cracking joke untimely putting on clothes weirdly keeping things here and there
reduction in the ability to do fundamental things like bathing wearing clothes eating etc
losing control on oneself suddenly
becoming restless shouting and fighting in anger
shitting in clothes or even in open
such often occurs in the last stages of dementia disease
difficulty in speaking dizziness loss of weight difficulty in sleep etc symptoms also may arise in dementia disease
all these symptoms should be present in patient together such is not essential
every patient of dementia may have his own different symptoms
if this disease is due to the reason of the disease named alzheimer then the death of patient occurs between to years
on the occurrence of this disease before years its more serious form comes forward
the ex president of america ronald reagan had also become the vitim of this disease only
in the film black amitabh bachchan has been shown to be suffering from this disease only
god knows how many women and girls due to not being able to express straight the complexes of the mind suppressed desires problems and difficulties exhibit in the form of hysteria
even after tiring to know intensely many times it becomes difficult to know the matters on their mind and this problem goes on continuing for long time
in one way the problem of hysteria is the voice of the mind
generally the meaning of hysteria is considered in the form of the onset of bots of unconsciousness
but there are many types of hysteria
due to ignorance this myth is popular pervasively that this disease occurs due to the effect of various supernatural powers ghost spirits souls of dead etc
actually hysteria disease occurs due to the reason of the problems happening at the mental level
in india hysteria disease is found more in married women
the disease of hysteria is found in children from years to even men
the chance of the occurrence of the disease of hysteria is the maximum between the age of up to years
in psychiatry hysteria is known by the name of dissociative disorder
the symptoms of the disease of hysteria are as follows
occurrence of seizures in this various types of symptoms can occur together or separately
like breathing rapidly or with difficulty throwing limbs here and there in air staying unconscious for many hours tightening of fist the pupils continuing to move after the closing of eyes etc
the seizures of hysteria are different from the seizures of epilepsy
theatrical hysteria in this the patient conducts as if in him there is the residing of any god spirit or ghost and the powers of giving boon or punishment have come in him
that time the voice of the patient also changes
big crowd of audience get surrounded near him and people ask for favors from him
paralysis in this the condition of weakness appears in one or more organs like in hand foot shoulders etc
whose relation is not with any physical deformity or disease even
at times there is such feeling as if the body organ has stopped working
many times for doctor also differentiating between actual paralysis and hysterical paralysis becomes difficult
dumbness and noiselessness in these conditions the patient is not able to speak anything
but without any problem he can whisper can do his talking by writing or gesturing through hands
on investigation all the organs of the patient of hysteria like the tongue lips sound cord etc are found to be working in normal way
why does hysteria arise
the mind complicated by some problem when fails to find any solution then the situation of mental conflict arises
in such situation if any person is not able to face his mental strife or is not able to express his problem in any way then the suffering mind finds the way to escape from his problems or to express them through hysteria
often women due to social and domestic situations are not able to express their desires and feelings and consequently many types of internal conflict arise in their mind
these conflicts continuing in the sub conscious mind become the reason of hysteria
hysteria is completely the game of sub conscious mind
the addiction of intoxication is also the disease of mind
the biggest problem is this that those people who do intoxication they themselves do not know whether they are the victim of addiction or not
one person who takes eight ten pegs of alcohol only four or five times in month he assumes that the addiction of alcohol has occurred to him
on the other hand that person who takes half bottle of alcohol every night and can not sleep without drinking says to himself that no no am not drunkard drunkards are of different kind altogether
drink only some that also while sleeping
the person does the intoxication of anything and to him any of the three things out of six things given underneath apply to him then assume that he has been addicted or used to for intoxication
intense desire to take intoxicating substance
repeatedly failing in the attempts to quit intoxication
arising of physical and mental problems on the unavailability of intoxication lrb like the shivering of limbs on not getting alcohol not getting sleep or getting restless rrb
gradual increase in the quantity of intoxication lrb because after some time the effect of the previous quantity starts reducing rrb
for example the person doing smack intoxication in some months from half gram smack his coming to two gram smack
wasting lot of time in the consumption of intoxicating substances
the person ignoring the other aspects of his life like socializing doing his work care of the children etc
intoxication is harming the body despite knowing this continuing intoxication
for example despite jaundice and vomiting blood not stopping the consumption of alcohol
apart from this other symptoms like intoxication in solitude harm to the physical and mental health taking intoxication in large quantity in one go etc are also the signals of the problem of intoxication
beer whisky champagne vodka rum gin brandy alcohol country made alcohol etc come in the category of alcohol
in the category of tobacco bidi cigarette cigar tobacco powder etc
canabis charas marijuana sulpha hashish all these substances are obtained from the plant of canabis lrb hemp rrb
sleeping pills like diazepam nitrozapam alprazola lrb alprex rrb etc
opium related substance opium smack brown sugar capsules proxivon and spasmovon the pills of lomotil etc
other substances amphitamin solvent lrb petrol eraser fluid polish etc rrb cocaine tea coffee etc
tea coffee are also in fact intoxicating substances but due to not being much harmful they have been accepted on the social basis
being mentally or physically dependent on substances affecting the activities of body and brain is only called the addiction of intoxication
the addiction of intoxication has been considered mental disorder
the indians alone drink approximately crore litre of alcohol during year
the consumption of alcohol in india is continuously gaining strength
if the drunkard is able to quit alcohol foursome months then it is good riddance because during this his body and liver gain strength as earlier
but if the liver has become absolutely bad then even after quitting alcohol it does not become alright
for the patient it is very difficult to quit alcohol on his own is very difficult
for this lot of will power is needed which is formed in very few people
some people think that by gradually reducing the quantity of alcohol one day will completely quit it in fact such people deceive themselves
like this it is nearly impossible to quit the addiction of alcohol
in order to get rid of this problem it is extremely important to take the advice of the psychiatrist
people in whom there is no internal desire to quit alcohol their family members should certainly meet their closest psychiatrist once
many times the work appearing difficult is in fact easy
through some methods in such addicted people producing the internal desire to quit drinking may be tried
to treat addiction two method are used one is through medicines and second through behavioural treatment
in the treatment through medicines some special medicines are started after completely stopping the alcohol of the patient
after some days of this the patient and his family members are told about two different types of medicines
one medicine helps in reducing the addiction of alcohol while the second medicine produces negative effect as the alcohol is consumed
due to this medicine reddening of the face vomiting breathlessness restlessness giddiness fainting etc occur
due to the fear of these negative effects the person stops consuming alcohol
in the behavioural treatment talking with patient counselling relaxation exercise desensitization aversion therapy group therapy etc are included
along with medicines behavioural treatment also has very important contribution in treatment
no matter what the addiction is after getting the treatment percent people again start the intoxication within few months
in such situation the patient and his family members should meet with his doctor again without feeling sad
today the main aim for the treatment of intoxication of the psychiatrists world over is to keep the person addiction free for long time after successful treatment
if the person drinking alcohol more than required is not ready to stop alcohol completely or else is unsuccessful in doing this then the consumption of alcohol in controlled way may be one way of treatment
this method is determined after talking to the doctor
abstain from the quacks advertising the medicines for quitting alcohol without telling
never ever make the patient consume any such medicine because due to these medicines if the patient consumes alcohol then due to negative effect lrb reaction rrb the patient may even die due to this
keep in mind that addiction also is the disease of mind only
other diseases like running nose cold cough may occur again similarly the addiction to intoxication may also occur again
therefore do not panic take stem for repeated treatment
apart from the addiction of intoxication the addicted person may also become the victim of other mental problems like worry depression fear suicide etc
after leaving any intoxication its desire lrb the intense desire to do intoxication rrb troubles the person for some days
this way after gaining control the desire to do intoxication dies gradually
after the treatment the doubt of the family members on the behavior and conduct of the patient becomes the cause of complex for the patient
due to this in anger he can start the intoxication again
therefore the family members not making the environment of apprehension should increase mutual co ordination and trust with the patient so that on doing intoxication again he himself tells about it
the consumption of these pills is not any serious subject till the time its consumption is done according to the advice of the doctor
the intoxication of tobacco is also like mental disease just like other intoxications whose treatment is possible
among the cancer occurring to indians percent cancer is due to the reason of tobacco
every year due to the reason of smoking people die
at the time of quitting intoxication the desire produced for intoxication troubles maximum to the person at the time of quitting intoxication
once after the production of the desire of intoxication it stays for nearly to minutes
to gain control over these desire of intoxication is little difficult but not impossible
after quitting the intoxication of tobacco it is natural process for the increase of kilograms in the weight of the person
on the increase of weight there is no need for any panic
in the entire world nearly million lrb crore rrb people are suffering with mental problems
not just this among chief diseases of the world making man incapable are of psychological type

tagore says whenever laugh then the burden of my mind is lightened
the secret of the popularity of gandhiji was his love for fun
gandhiji writes laugh unties the knots of mind very easily
not of my mind alone but of your mind well
laugh is one simple natural process but it is an amazing process
this is one basic nature which is found only in humans
it is said that person devoid of literature music and art is like animal
this thing is right to some extent but if seen on behavioural level then the person who does not use this gift of laughter endowed to man by nature then he is the biggest animal
human body is like laboratory in which every moment biochemical and electromagnetic changes continue taking place
as result of these various changes man gets the feeling of happiness and pain
mind has deciding role in this
according to our psychological state the bio chemical structure of our body is only affected
optimistic psychological state has positive and negative psychological state has negative impact on the bio chemical structure of our body
laughing is one such process which puts only positive effect on human body because in the process of laughing the role of mind becomes null or negligible
the person laughing reaches to the state of no state that very moment which is the state of meditation only
when you laugh then in those moments you reach to the state of deep thought or meditation on your own because at one time only laughing and meditation becomes impossible
the meaning of laughter is to produce obstruction in thought process
if you really laugh in reality then the thought process whether it is positive or negative stops immediately because at one time you do only one thing holistically
because of our incomplete activities our life becomes haphazard and imbalanced
therefore whatever action you do that in complete attention
in laughter especially in the state of laughing heartily one is able to control the restlessness of the mind no matter if it is momentary
that momentary control over the restlessness of the mind is an incredible incident
for man it is beneficial situation for his good health
laughter is in fact condition of instant yoga
the more the recurrence of these moments that much we will go near the yoga rich life
by laughing the benefit of exercise is also obtained
by laughing forcefully the breathing process is also affected
therefore the practice of both yogasan and pranayam occurs in the action of laughter
due to laughing because of the consumption of extra calories one gets help in controlling the weight
due to laughing because of the increase in blood circulation freshness appears in the body especially the muscles of the face
yoga is complete treatment methodology
laughter is also not less than any type of yoga therefore through laughter the medical treatment is related to laughter
after yoga practice and other physical activities and aerobics and athletics etc the practice of laughter is also done
after sports and mental labor the tiredness of body relieved with laughter and one more freshness comes in the body
not only in sports but in the matter of personality development and during motivational workshops as well the inclusion of laughter is must because after good laugh the attention of the person becomes more concentrated and becomes centred on the subject again
in everything literature culture and art laughter is certainly present in some or the other form otherwise reader or subscriber would not be able to establish harmony
laughter is complete exercise in which all the nerves of the body open and the body becomes fresh after the tiredness of the body is removed
by laughing openly good exercise of lungs throat and mouth occurs
the nerves of stomach and chest become strong
the diaphragm becomes strong and by this one gets help in the treatment of the diseases related to mouth throat and lungs
by laughter the rate of blood flow becomes fast because of which the quantity of oxygen in the blood increases
in this entire process glow comes on the face
the more one laughs and makes the other laugh that much more his face would glow
the more the absorption of oxygen in the body that much more energy would be produced and as much energy is produced that much we will stay disease free
this way laughter is the healing and nutritive element of life and it may also be called the essence of life
through laughter changes come in the bio chemical construction of our body
due to laughter reduction comes in the level of hormones producing tension namely cortisone and epinephrine because of which the body becomes tension free and the meaning of tension free is health
apart from this due to laughter the quantity of hormone named endorphin increase which is natural painkiller and works as disease immunity for the body
according to the research of dr lee berk of rosalinda university of california lymphocytes stay more active because of laughing and staying happy because of which there is increase in the growth of those natural cells which are called killer cells
these killer cells are capable of destroying those dangerous cells capable of the growth of cancer
this way by laughing one gets help in getting rid of dangerous diseases
when you are surrounded by depression then laughter only is one such medicine which can stop your depression
due to laughing all the pain all tensions melt away
due to laughing the body gets relief after becoming tired
due to laughing good sleep comes
cheerful person never suffers from depression and not even does the activity of suicide
objectively the treatment of all the depressing diseases is hidden in laughter
objectively laughter is the only one such medicine which is capable of stopping wrinkles externally and is helpful in making you full of motivation internally
with laughter exercise you can say good bye to old age forever
laughter is spiritual health laughter is burden less
when you laugh then you can keep your mind separate
the person who can not laugh for him the door of intellect is closed
for me the importance of laughter is high
any religion has not thought of laughter ever
religion has always emphasized on seriousness and therefore all the world went on becoming sick psychologically
seriousness is mental state produced from negative pont of view while laughter is state obtained from positive point of view
through laughter throw away the coat of negative point of view or seriousness forever
leave making excuses and smile little
after this laugh and laugh strongly
this only is the invaluable essence of life and the art of living the life with enthusiasm
in homeopathy the treatment of esitinse disease has proved to be fruitful
in last stage of patient suffering with liver disease esitinse disease has been seen
in esitinse disease water accumulates in the stomach
this esitinse is seen in the disease of kidney the disease of peritoneum heart disease sound system self stopping fever cancer the diseases of blood vessels
esitinse is not disease on its own but this disease is seen in the guise of other diseases
in esitinse disease due to the accumulation of water in the stomach the front portion of the stomach appears to be big and high the amount of urine decreases and often constipation persists
in esitinse disease there is difficulty in respiration
in this disease the heart beats strongly and sometimes one feels thirsty and sometimes not
in homeopathy in the disease of esitinse the following medicines can be administered and observed
you can see by giving epismel if the urine is very less there is no thirst there is intense pain in the muscles of the stomach inflammation and pain in the body at various places like stings difficulty in respiration on lying down relief in sitting down
the aposinum medicine is fruitful in all types of swellings
due to eposynum disease there is intense excitement in gall bladder
aposynum medicine is given to the patient on the occurrence of the following symptoms vomiting immediately after drinking water urinating like mud dysentery
apart from this among other homeopathic medicines chayna colchicam canbalbulus ars lycopodium natrumsulph etc medicines are those which you can take under the guidance of the nearest able doctor
why do we yawn
according to dr balasubramaniam there are many things in the daily life which are considered common but we do not have any explanation of these with us
yawning is one such thing
if see you yawning then why do also start yawning
why is yawning like an infection
why do we start yawning little time before going top bed and immediately after getting up
together with yawning why do we stretch
someone had said that yawning is like economics regarding which everyone has his one favorite explanation
very popular belief is this that we yawn then when we need more oxygen
but it has been found that this belief about yawning is not correct
dr robert provin of maryland university is doing research on yawnings for long time
dr robert provin made some people sit in the room and kept on changing the composition of air
at first he made the volume of carbon dioxide percent in the room and observed the rate of yawning in people
after this he made the volume of carbon dioxide zero percent and once more the rate of yawnings were seen
it has been seen that both the times the rate of yawnings lrb dimension rrb has been nearly equal
do we take more yawnings when we are tired
no difference has been seen in the dimension of yawnings before the exercise during and afterwards
does yawning have any relation with age
it has been found that new born baby and even the foetus yawn
during ultrasound inspection yawnings have been recorded in twenty weeks pregnancy
it seems that this action is approximately as important as respiration movement of eyes and parturition during birth
this is an involuntary action on which the person does not have any control
yawning is not simple action
on average yawning is of to seconds
during yawning the air is inhaled till deep and then released all of sudden
during yawning the heartbeat rate increases up to percent and many types of nervous scientific changes occur in the brain
it seems that the relation of yawning is to the attentiveness of waking up
by this one understands as to why long spells of yawning comes to people suffering from nervous scientific problems lrb epilepsy multiple sclerosis rrb
it can be that yawning also does the work of psychological pressure release
it is clear that yawning is not just the symbolism of boredom sadness and the lack of oxygen alone
on the basis of the nature of the disease the availability of the related medicine and its process of effect the doctor prescribes the patient to take pills injection and syrup according to the need
maximum medicines are available in all the three forms of pills syrup lrb solution rrb injection
then also there are many such allopathic medicines which are available in one form only
keeping the condition of the patient age condition of the disease and the effect of the medicine in sight the medicine is made to reach the body through the following media
through the mouth the medicine is given in the form of tablet lrb pill rrb capsule syrup lrb solution rrb
the cover of capsule is made of gelatine which melts after going to the gall bladder
with the name of medicines which are to be drunk you often read linctuses mixture emulsion
from linctus the meaning is of that medicine which generally is in sweet solution
mixture is the solution of many medicines in water or in other chemicals
in emulsion there are two solvents which generally becomes negligible
the medicine of heart disease is placed on the tongue which shows effect immediately by melting gradually
this medium of taking the medicine is called sub lingual medium
injection and allopathic treatment have become the synonym of each other
for giving glucose and other medicine fast into the body injection is given intravenous that is through the medium of arteries
the veins visible on the outer part of the body take the deoxygenated blood towards the heart
opposite to this the arteries situated in the deeper parts of the body take the blood to the rest of the body from the heart
in the arteries this blood flows with the speed of kilometre per hour
then only the arteries are heard to be beating fast
in general terms it only is called pulse
the second popular medium of giving injection is intramuscular that is giving injection in the muscles
generally injection is put on the upper or outer part of the arm or the upper part of the hips only
actually in both these places the nerves beneath the flesh is less
if any nerve gets damaged through the needle of the injection then it can be lethal for the patient
apart from these popular methods there are subcutaneous and intradermal methods as well
in these methods instead of putting the injection deeply in the flesh it is put at low depth beneath the skin
the turbutaline injection in respiratory disease and insulin injection of diabetes is put through this method only
in the subcutaneous method the effect of the medicine is slow
apart from this injection is also put in stomach lrb peritoneal rrb in chect lrb pectoral rrb and spinal cord lrb spinal rrb
in the diseases like asthma and cough the patient takes in some medicine by inhaling through breathing
the medicine to make unconscious during surgery lrb ether rrb is also given through this medium alone
in the medium of local application ointment balm oil etc are applied in body pain warts injury itching atc on the essential places
the ointment applied on the nose ear and eyes and glycerine etc applied on mouth ulcers also come under this category alone
how does the medicine show its effect
the medicines given through the injection enter the blood flow directly only
therefore the effect also is quick and pervasive
the medicines taken through mouth digest with the food in gall bladder and intestines
the intestines fail to absorb these medicines completely
if they stomach is empty then the oral medicines show more effect
the medicine absorbed through the intestines goes to the liver through the postal vessel
if the functioning of the liver is not alright then maximum medicines become inactive
various types of enzymes affect the chemical activities of the medicines
from the liver the medicine goes to the heart and from there through the pumping action it sends the blood to every cell of the body
the medicine travels in the entire body through the plasma available in the blood
these medicines finally mix with the fluid available outside the cell and show their effect wherever there is need of medicines
after the consumption the remaining medicine is excreted through the urine after reaching the kidney from the heart through the medium of the excretory parts of the cells
therefore during the excretion of some medicines the color of the urine appears to be yellow red or dark
which medicine stays in the body for how long and for how long it affects on this basis alone the doctor prescribes the mode of taking the medicine to the patient
even after scholarly studies and researches the exact theory of the effect of the medicine has not been developed
receptor theory proceeds by considering this that along with special tissues there is construction named receptor in the body which attaches to and then speeds up as the medicine comes close to the tissue
the second theory is of antimetaolitis according to which the cells acquire their nutrition from special type of elements
the antibacterial medicines too possess the shape of nutritive elements
as such the microbes etc consider these as nutrition and their growth stops
finally the microbes die and the patient become alright
enzymes are those elements which are helpful in fastening the various chemical activities in the body
some enzymes do the work of ferrying the liquid inside and outside of the cells
some medicines are capable of affecting the general nature of these enzymes and the functioning cells
allopathic medicines are made of various types of plants minerals chemicals and the body of animals
these medicines show effect according to the nature of the specific disease
some medicines fulfil the deficiency of special elements in the body while some deactivate the chemicals which have increased
similarly some medicines provide speed to the activities of the body while some finish off the growing microbes
due to this reason alone the side effects lrb ill effects rrb of english medicine is also very much
not sleep the base of the entire health is yoganidra
as it is clear from the name alone the attainment of the condition of sleep through yoga only is yoganidra
what is yoga
the control over the activities of will or mind alone is yoga
handicappedness is an extremely ancient and omnipresenet problem
the people of all the parts religions and communities of the world get affected with handicappedness more or less
everyone male female rich poor can be the victim of handicappedness
with time change has come in the appearance of this problem of handicappedness
today control has been achieved to very great extent on measles reasons of blindness at birth leprosy polio etc
the cases of cerebral palsy and mental retardation are increasing
the spread of education in handicaps is also increasing and the understanding of people towards handicappedness is also becoming positive
technical development has provided artificial reading power to blind people better hearing power to deaf people improved movement to skeletally handicapped people
the development of medical science has prevented the growth of diseases and put reins on the process of conversion of diseases on handicappedness
the spreading of education among handicapped people is increasing due to the efforts of indian government state governments and self help organizations
today the situation has come to this that by providing suitable environment and extra facilities the handicapped people can be included in the mainstream of society
by providing obstruction free environment we can provide them with opportinity to become respected citizens
now instead of becoming burden on the society the handicapped people may come in the condition of contributing to the society
computer information technology automation have made working for handicapped people very simple
now in comparison to normal people handicapped people may contribute better
the weakening of any part of body situation arising due to deformation is called handicappedness
before understanding handicappedness well it is essential to understand the various organs and their working
the ability of sight plays important role in our life
most of our activities are possible because of our reason of seeing
the various types of deformities occuring in eyes become the reason of vision imparement
how much is the vision impairement this specialist doctor can tell only after complete check up but there is also an easy method of testing it
if person is not able to count the fingers of person standing at the distance of three metres then he can be considered visually impaired
the complete investigation of visually impaired person is essential
big part of the eye ball is white
this white part maintains the shape of the eye and also protects its fragile construction
small part exists in front of the eye which is called cornea and it works as window
light enters through the medium of cornea
hearing impairment is that condition in which child or adult is incapable of hearing partially or in complete form
there are many types of hearing impairment
many times outer and middle ear fail to transmit sound to the inner ear
in such situation the person faces difficulty in hearing
one more reason for this can be this that dirt gets accumulated in the canal of the ear
apart from this deformity in the construction of the bones of the ear injury or because of the reason of any disease also it can happen
the reason of other type of deafness can be the deformity in the inner ear
the more the deformity more is the loss of hearing ability
in the innere ear place is decided for every frequency
in the inner ear the loss at any frequency becomes less and on some it becomes extremely high
there are many reasons of this type of deformity but generally due to the reason of damage of the minute construction of cochlea this deformity takes birth
in some children due to the damage occuring in cochlea the ability to bear loud noise gets destroyed
the more the damage becomes the ability of child to recognize words become that much less
when the damage occurred in the cochlea it does not get corrected through treatment and surgery then there is no other way leaft apart from wearing the hearing aid
if the pregnant woman suffers from from viral fever influenza chicken pox mumps etc in the first trimester then the child in the womb can be adversely affected
the child in the womb can also become deaf
in childhood diseases like meningitis jaundice typhiod measles can put adverse effect on the hearing ability of the person
the complications during birth like foreceps delivery can have influence on the ear
continuous flow of water and pus may also become the reason of becoming deaf
if the pregnant woman eats unnecessary medicine without the consult of the doctor for abortion or any disease then there could be adverse effect on the foetus and it may also become deaf
there are two ways of safety from deafness
first way is this that one should stay away from those diseases which give birth to deafness
second this that if there has been the influence of this disease then it should be prevented from being converted to handicappedness
the useful instrument used for hearing in deaf people is basically small electronic appliance
this electronic appliance is also called minute mike
through this electronic appliance or minute mike the sound can be amplified many times
speaking is actually special process which differentiates us from other organisms
if by months the child is not able to speak meaningful word then it is essential to get him tested
if by this age the child starts speaking words like mummie papa then there is no reason to worry
if the voice of the child is abnormal heavier or comes with obstruction then also it is essential to get it hecked up
during management program the exercises for the growth of child is being done
during management plan the activities of daily life are taught
the child is taught to speak move etc under the management plan
under this the difficulties of the children are solved and the treatment of the diseases are also done
some activities among these take place in hospital or rehabilitation center and some take place at home alone
the activities which take place at home are demonstrated to the mother father and important instructions are given to be repeated at home
according to the american association of mental retardation that person is called mentally retarded who is not able to do his simple activity
the measurement of intelligence is less than and bothe these problems start affecting the person from the age of years only
from years the child learns to stand up walk run eat wear clothes use toilet keep clean to converse etc
from years to years of age the child learns to read write talk meaningfully to help etc
from to years of agethe child learns to do all his domestic work and lears to use hospital post office public vehicle phone etc
the child acquires skill in sports and entertaining activities as well
the child learns to do useful work as well
that child whose growth rate is less than the above mentioned rate he is considered to be mentally retarded
intelligence measurement scale is method to measure intelligence prepared by the scientists
the average iq of man is from to
if the iq is between to then the man can lead satisfactory life
if the iq is less than then the man is considered to be mentally retarded
on the iq being less than it becomes essential to pay attention to him
if the iq is between to then the man is considered to be less mentally retarded
the man with iq between to is considered to be average mentally retarded
if the iq is between to then he is considered to be extremely mentally retarded
the people with iq less than are considered to be extremely serious
making mentally retarded child recognize himself and learn his own name is an art in itself
for this during all the activities of the menatlly retarded child like bathing changing clothes eating playing etc his name should be called
apart from this after showing the reflection of the child in mirror his name should be called out so that he can recognize himself
for making the mentally retarded child learn to drink milk at first he is made to sit in front of the mirror and shown to hold the glass
the child becomes happy by seeing himself in the mirror drinking milk
initially the child has to be given support but later on the child the child starts drinking on his own
people who are mentally ill are entirely different from mentally retartded people
the iq of the person mentally ill is average or more than average
the growth of the person mentally ill also takes place normally
these people are victims of the psychological disorder and become alright through medicine or psychological treatment
due to psychological disorder their feelings become deformed and along with it effect is seen on the intelligence as well
the persons mentally ill generally become alright after treatment and lead normal life at home
those people who do not get alright and do dangerous activities they are kept at mental hospitals
if the hands of the person are incapable then he would considered to be the victim of the impairement of the upper skeleton
if the legs are incapable then he would be considered to be the victim of impairement of lower skeletan
there are many reasons of skeletal impairment and some among these start from pregnancy itself
many diseases occurring to the pregnant mother become the cause of handicapedness in the child in the womb
many times from the time of birth the hands or feet of the child remain underdeveloped or are not there at all
in such situation the person does maximum work with the help of assisting instruments or artificial organs
many times the loss of hands can be fulfilled with legs and the loss of legs with hands
the legs of many children are twisted and deformed from birth
attempt should be made to straighten such deformed feet as soon as possible because the bones and joints of children are soft
cerebral palsy is one of the deformities occurring from birth and is sufficiently dangerous
due to the damage occurring in the brain some organs of the brain stop functioning
jaundice is major reason of cerebral palsy
in the state of jaundice one can be saved from this situation by giving blood to the child as soon as possible
high fever vommitting etc occurring in new born baby become the causes of cerebral palsy
apart from this many children become victims of
the condition of cerebral palsy persists life long because there is no treatment for this
but on the other side if correct opportunities are provided to the suffering child then to sufficient extent he can become responsible and man of independent personality
in the management of child suffering with cerebral palsy the role of parents and guardian is important
therefore for preparing parents for this work continuous consult and support should be given
the guardians must be shown the way to recognize specialities of the child and to help and support them in order to fulfil their deficiencies
there is also the need of special instruments to the child suffering with cerebral palsy
with these instruments the children suffering with cerebral palsy are able to do many types of work easily
muscular dystrophy is one such disease in which the muscles continue becoming weak gradually
muscular dystrophyis of three types
in the first type of the disease of muscular dystrophy the growth of the child occurs at first normally or little gradually
when the child is of years then he faces difficulty in walking strolling running climbing etc
later on in muscular dystrophy difficulty comes in standing as well
after some days the child is forced to stay lying on the bed
in the other types the rate of the muscular dystrophy disease is less or more
is of many types bones and joints also become its victim
due to the reason of the rotation of the joints stops
if reaches to the spinal cord then hunch comes out and paralysis may attack
in india around one and half crore people are affected with and one fourth among these have become the victim of handicappedness
the disease of lathyrism is disease that occurs due to excessive use of grasspea
grasspea is cheap and is eaten by the poor class in the large area of madhya pradesh uttar pradesh bihar orissa
due to the use of grasspea first the person feels weakness in walking and then becomes obligated to take the prop of stick
despite ban this grasspea is still eaten
during to handicappedness there is much more psychological damage than the physical damage
in fact with the information of handicappedness very big shock is received to the person
if we see from the scientific point of view then all the parts of our body work independently
the effect of bad or inactive organ is not seen on the other healthy organs
there are very few such diseases which show effect on other organs together
therefore it may be believed that the reproductive organs of the handicapped person would be normal
he can keep his partner happy by using his reproductive power and can fulfil family duties
those women who have damaged spinal cord they can also become pregnant
during pregnancy the women with damaged spinal cord may have to face various types of complications
these complications are untimely pain ulcer due to pressure etc
because of the spinal cord being damaged these women fail to feel the movement of the foetus
the delivery in such women is possible through foreceps and other other methods
there is no difficulty to deaf and dumb in walking
menatlly retarded or people suffering from psychological disorders also walk easily
there is heavy difficulty to blind people and skeletally handicapped people in movement
there is need of training for walking to blind people and skeletally handicapped people
in new blind people there is huge lack of confidence
newly blinds become anxious on slight problem and in anxiety fail to even go for little approximation
therefore for such blind people the training of movement is that much essential as the learning of braille
blind person can recognize objects to very great extent with touch
blind person can estimate by touching by using hands or feet
blind person can estimate many things by smelling inside or outside the home
on the basis of smell the blind person estimates many shops factories or offices
when we walk then the effect of the forthcoming obstacles is seen on our muscles and joints
by this also we come to know to great extent as to where we are walking
different types of places grassy road sandy area or an area filled with mud puts different types of effects on the muscles and joints of our feet
similarly while traveling in bus climbing up the stairs or while opening the doors our muscles feel differently
on the basis of these fellings the blind can come to know of his situation and direction
the person with sight should stand in front of the blind person
the blind person should hold the arm of the blind person by standing one step back
the skeletally challenged person also is made to learn movement
after the sudden skeletal handicappedness where its physical capacity decreases there its confidence also shatters
in such while the skeletally challenged person is need of assisting instruments to move there he also needs someone to give the right directions
stick is the oldest assisting instrument in which there is the use of straight wood
on the upper part of the stick there is one handle
at present there is also the use of aluminium stick which is light and strong
below this aluminium tip there is rubber tip which keeps good hold on the floor
when wheels are attachd to the normal chair then it is called wheel chair
after sitting on this chair the victim of serious handicappedness also can come up to some distance
motorised wheel chair for going inside and outside of house and office are also available which have brakes as well
at present the complaint of contamination in things for eating and drinking are becoming common
ghee oil milk spices and in fact in vegetables as well as the use of chemicals is serious problem
certainly by consuming contaminated things we are straight away inviting diseases
the chemicals mixed in these contaminated things affect our immune system directly by which the problems of dehydration vomiting etc may occur
this way by the use of substances mixed with these chemicals there is risk of the occurrence of the diseases connected to nervous system etc
with contaminated things not just liver but the effect is also seen on intestines
we can overcome this problem provided we stay cautious
in order to stay away from the ill effects of contaminated food materials we must at first try to buy goods of good quality
an alternative from being saved from contaminated food materials may be branded items but many times complaints may arise even in them
therefore for you organic foods would be safe
the biggest benefit of organic food products is this that no type of chemical substances can be used in them
on the other hand the complaint of the mixing of fruits and vegetables and the use of chemicals to ripen them is also coming forward regularly
this may also prove harmful with respect to health
as such from the point of view of safety you must eat the fruit after peeing them off
similar things you can do with vegetables as well
not just this you wash fruits and vegetables many times before use so that more and more color on them gets washed
just nutritive food is not essential but staying cautious is also essential so that the chemicals do not go inside with nutrition in the body
the problem of handicappedness is ancient and the efforts of their diagnosis are also equally ancient
the level of technical dvelopment has been having continuous influence on these efforts
the national institute for the visually handicapped have developed various types of assisting instruments for various purposes
for the higher education of handicapped people latest braille slates tailor frame instruments to solve numericals and algebra and kit helpful in geometry have also been prepared
for the handicapped persons the set of pictures helpful in the study of physics have also been developed
with the help of all these assisting instruments related to education the blind person can read new and every type of subjects
for general blind persons tools for threading needle for shorthand etc have also been developed
for the physical development and the entertainment of blind people many things of games have also been developed
for the blind people the ringing balls in cricket and football etc have been developed
tactile chess for sitting down and playing cards of braille pocket frame etc have been manufactured
for the locomotion of blind people the stick which is brought in use have also been developed
although the braille script has been of support for the blind people from long time but with time improvements have come in this as well
now one after the other such machines have come in which the typing of braille takes place as fast as possible
the person types normal words on the computer and simultaneously the attached machine continues taking out the print in braille
now in less time newspaper letters magazines or books can be prepared
where such machines are being imported from foreign institutions there in india as well many organizations are doing research in this direction
voice synthesizer has also become common now and has become available in less price
whatever is fed into the computer the attached voice synthesizer reads it aloud
previously the blind people used to get scared with calculation and maths
now after the invention of voice calculator not just the anxiety of the blind people has vanished but now they can also work at the place of calculations
at present in our country there is adequate arrangement of making artificial leg or calliper etc according to severed legs or weak legs
the leg is severed below the knee or above the artficial leg can be fixed
similarly to whatever extent of the leg is weak or distorted the callipers can be prepared and these are very helpful
these callipers can be worn for many years easily
in order to make club foot straight initially and or the making of special shoes according to them is also easy
when the person becomes handicapped after becoming victim of disease or accident then his treatment is done in various ways
among these various types of surgical treatment physical treatment physiotherapy occupational therapy etc are included
at present to great extent benefit has been observed in various cases of polio leprosy accidents
in the country there is web of the centres of alimco and mahavir handicapped institute where every type of artificial organ and calliper etc are available
through the surgical treatment the effort of making the patients of cerebral palsy normal is ongoing
due to the development in medical science the lost eye sight is retieved once again and the diseases do make the person blind
the biggest example of this is earler people in large numbers used to become blind due to cataract
now with simple surgery the treatment of cataract is done
through the intra occular lens the person continues to take benefit of the complete sight capacity
at present with the surgery transparency is brought back
in the schools through the regular treatments of children prevention is applied on the diseases of eyes and the increasing diseases are corrected
in various cases when the person starts living his life after considering himself blind then with the surgery of cornea he starts seeing
organisations like mahavir vikalang sahayata samiti have provided artificial organs to people by visiting villages and investigating on large scale
similarly in such camps the surgery of cataract of the eyes of people has been done successfully
one more solution of the diagnosis of the problem of handicappedness is this that so much facilities and concessions should be given to the handicapped people so that there could be sufficient compensation to the losses occurring due to physical disabilities
according to the order issued by the railway ministry blind people physically challenged deaf dumb and mentally retarded people would get percent concession on the fares of first class second class and sleeper class
also in season ticket the handicapped people get percent concession
leaving deaf dumb the assistants traveling with all the other type of handicaps also get this much concession
in air travel only indian airlines gives percent concession to the blind people
in order to give more and more employment to the handicapped people they are provided with percent reservation in dealership
the handicapped people need assissting tools in order to carry out normal work
therefore poor handicaps should be given assistance to buy tools
people with the monthly income of twelve hundred rupees get the aid equipments worth rupees
volunteer intitutions are given aids to educate children afflicted with cerebral palsy and mentally undeveloped children and for preparation of teachers and other experts to rehabilitate them
in the same way institutions working for the rehabilitation of people after the treatment of leprosy and bringing them in the meanstream are also given up to percent economical support
the institutions that run special schools for the disabled people of different varieities are given economical aids up to percent
the districts which do not have special schools this aid is given on priority basis
besides this different aids programs are also run through district rehabilitation centres regional rehabilitation centres
trachoma disease occurs due to bacteria
trachoma disease gets spreading through the dirty hands polluted towels etc
flies also play an important role in spreading trachoma disease
trachoma disease is more in those areas where poor people live and there is plethora of dust
the areas having lack of water also have trachoma in plenty
open and dirty toilets open sewers twittering of the flies also increase the number of trachoma disease
in trachoma disease there is burning in the eye and the eye waters
due to the disease of trachoma the eyes also get reddened
in such situation it is essential to keep the eyes clean
also by taking the advice of the doctor the treatment of trachoma should be started

abstain from eating food in the roadside eateries
they use low quality oil for many days
clear soup and green vegetable are helpful in increasing appetite
abstain from naan and rumali roti because maida is used in them
in their place eat missi roti lrb made of thick grains rrb and fulke
in food take only one gravy vegetable
the meaning of more gravy in food is excess fat
it is even said little gravy is sufficient
choose one type of food
to not complement bhel and kachori with chopsey and pork windalu with sambhar wada
the diet of three dishes is sufficient
escape from diet of five dishes
state clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried fried cooked at high temperature or roasted food
in food take wine or water instead of cola
wine can complement with indian food
cola can give rise to gas related problems
contaminated water or vapor rich water has ill effects on digestive system
these days due to gas bile and phlegm separately or by the combination of two or all the three several types of disease must be arising
therefore in monsoon season fire must be safeguarded cautiously
due to the subduction of fire there are lethal consequences on health
due to the deformation of fire the person suffers from many types of disease
during rainy season one should abstain from the consumption of fire enhancing medicines gas reducer and digestion enhancer medicines
one should drink mixing the juice of lentil etc old barley wheat shali rice shadras mastu black salt pippali pippalamool chavya chitrak and sonth
the water of well or rain or boiled water should be consumed
during the days of excess rain sour mineral rich and fragrant cereals should be used
in dryness honey rich easily digestive substance should be consumed
take bath after applying fragrant oil etc wear the clothes after using perfume etc

in the medicine world among the various popular methods of treatment the place of natural treatment is important
our body is self controlled active tool
the god has made the arrangement of self defense health safety inside our body itself
that system in which there is method of staying free of disease by supporting nature there are rules that only is called natural treatment
when people feel restless and uncomfortable after becoming infested with indigestion weakness and rot due to wrong lifestyle incompatible and untimely food then to get rid of them they use various medicines injections
through these medicines injections even more dirt gets accumulated in the body
the disease is not eliminated by medicnes
one symptom of the complication gets suppressed and becomes the reason of another disease
the body tries for its own defense
the nature tries comprehensively to remove the dirt present in the body
naturopathy helps in removing and throwing away this dirt from our body
naturopathy makes the person healthy strong and full of glow
fast juice fruits balanced diet natural lifestyle are helpful in naturopathy
with the method of air sunlight water massage exercise pranayam any disease is destroyed from the root
state clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried fried cooked at high temperature or roasted food
like in the villages as pollution arises in the drains and streets of villages disease is produced due to them
likewise dirt is accumulated in the body
this dirt of the body can not be excreted through the medium of toilet urine sweat etc and starts percolating inside
that dirt of the body is the root of all the diseases
if your disease is not able to be rectified by any medicine then get new life by adopting new natural treatment
health is natural and disease is unnatural
when we follow the rules of body and life then the health is natural
when we ignore the rules of body and life overlook then the disease is unnatural
the normal reaction of the normal situation of life force is health and abnormal reaction is disease
this condition of abnormal reaction is the reason of disease alone
therefore we can say that those symptoms because of which the situations of disease are produced they should be corrected
no effort should be taken in order to suppress the symptoms through traditional contemporary method and medicines
traditional treatment method has always followed the short term treatment policy
the excess pressure of traditional treatment stays on treatment
traditional treatment method does not rely on the philosophy of staying free of disease
we know that for the treatment of disease traditional treatment method has left no stone unturned in every possible research
the treatment of disease depends on the basis as to in what form do we take our disease
there is immense attack on the body in the form of medicine injection etc
by that action procedure the patient becomes disease free this is the general belief among people
on the basis of this wrong belief the use of all types of medicines are used on the diseases
that is simple cough and cold or dangerous cancer disease
the nature tries to maintain balance in the body
in the human body health and disease are two separate self religions in the human body
natural medicine never claims that it can free from all the stages of all types of dangerous diseases
but it definitely lays stress on the fact that by understanding the creative process of nature dependent rules certainly the people suffering with dangerous diseases can be helped
the fact is that at present the extent to which people have the knowledge of destructive forces that much less they have the knowledge about the process of life force
in the natural treatment the treatment is done of the patient and not of the disease
on the occurrence of disease for the treatment of disease it is important to stick to the rules of health and essential to stay away from the habits which produce disease matter and diet which produce the same
by abiding by the rules of health only all types of diseases are cured
by following the rules of health the treatment of the dangerous disease like cancer also is possible in the present times
for the treatment of disease adopt any where and any type of method
eat medicines but if you do not restricy yourself in food habits then the disease would not be corrected
someone consumes alcohol is in the habit of smoking cigarette bidi and his liver has become infectious is suffering from rheumatism arthritis psyctic disease etc
for these diseases the person eats different types of medicines
natural treatment is also done
but if they do not quit alcohol cigarette bidi etc then one can not get rid of the disease
by spending money of lacs and crores one can not free oneself of disease till the time one does not follow the rules of health
natural treatment is proud that the treatment of all types of diseases is possible in natural treatment
if the person will get the treatment done and do not quit the habits leading to disease then is its treatment possible
this is also true that if the person gets the treatment done by staying in any natural hospital where he is given diet and treatment under strict vigilence
the bad habits of the patient are removed with strictness
in that duration of staying in hospital it is natural to get relief
after coming back from the hospital again old habits eating habits and the rules of healthy life style are left then again there is attack of the diseases
the nature has given immense power to every living being to stay disease free
in order to rid us from diseases modern scientific development makes us aware of the behavioural and non destructive enriched energy of the nature
if once you become complete by the nature and follow its rules then you would always appear healthy and full of lively youth
in order to maintain health balanced diet self control yoga and exercise are essential
good health is ultimate bliss
the only key to health is the regular following of decided balanced diet by the diet specialists and yogasana by the yoga specialists
the secret to long life is in this only
not just long leaf also of good health and youthful life
it would be very justified to call the modern age as the pollution age because at every step there is pollution
iron and steel industries aviation motor and railways deafness of the ears due to the noise of loud speakers etc disorder of blood circulation irritation due to staying in tension beating of the heart increase of blood pressure diseases like cancer etc
diseases like tuberculosis cancer influenza asthma of throat and trachea etc are occuring due to the poisonous gases of motor cars and iron and steel industries and the spreading of pesticide chemicals in the plants in the fields
the residents of those places where the atmosphere is covered with viruses dust smoke moisture fog and cloud are found to be suffering from tuberculosis cancer nervous weakness rheumatism blood disorders etc
the effluents of poisonous pesticides plastic dye and the factories of rubber the dirty drains of the city and the poisonous substances of chemical fertilizers are polluting the sources of water and the diseases like diarrhoea piles and of skin are spreading
in the pollution of the earth flies mosquites and many harmful pests are being produced and are inviting the diseases like tuberculosis gastritis tetanus yellow fever malaria dysentery diorrhoea cancer etc
the edible items produced with chemical fertilizers make men and animals suffer from lethal diseases like cancer etc
the use of various types of chemicals on plants and cereals produce many types of dangerous diseases after reaching in our body
due to the use of wrong utensils also the food items become poisonous
contamination by greedy businessmen and the use of saccharine in drinking items make the civilized men suffer from dangerous diseases
there is more expenditure of life force in digesting more food and elimination of disorders produced due to them
by this its loss becomes definite
one is required to work in order to lead life
but rest is essential on getting tired
wandering uselessly without any aim tiring the one body is foolishness only and also with it there is also the reduction of life force
due to staying idle the physical and mental powers start getting destroyed very fast
work is life worklessness is death
flowing water is pure but the water standing at one place only produces foul smell
the brain of lazy the house of disease
like due to not using the motor car it gets rusted
due to working till late at night or partying or passing the entire night keeping awake wastage of life force is essential
due to keeping awake till late at night one can become the victim of mental disorder and sleeplessness etc
according the view of prof clark all our curing medicines are poison and as result every dose of medicine reduces the life force of the patient
allopathy suppresses the diseases with medicines and produces poisonous situation in the body
the destruction of life force starts with the use of medicines
the body continues to grow continuously for approximately upto years
the work of intelligence and construction is also finished in this period only
those men and women who destroy semen and menses in unnatural way there is no production of glaze fame revolution intelligence and strength
because of being extremely weak many dangerous diseases may be produced in men and women
according to medical science one drop of semen is produced by drops of blood
according to ayurveda one drop of semen is produced by drops of blood
according to yogashastra after semen discharge the death comes near and after it is digested in the body life is saved

what is balanced diet
form food the only aim of man is not just to fill stomach gain health or fulfil taste but also to bring about mind character and spiritual growth
the interest of man towards various types of foods is the symbol of his conduct and recognition
therefore in food the consumption of those types of foods should be done which is helpful in physical mental principle social and spiritual enhancement
balanced diet develops love affection friendship forgiveness tenderness non violence peace etc properties
grow the feeling of respect and honor toward the humans
those foods in which there is no fulfillment of the above mentioned things and the consequences come the opposite instead that food can not be called balanced
what type is nutritive diet
in the food the eleme nts providing energy strength and heat to the body like proteins glucose fat minerals vitamins etc should be present in proper ratio and sufficient quantity
due to which the growth of good cells in the body continues to take place
according to one own financial ability the selection of those substances may be done depending on the likeness and availabilty and personal necessity from the substances of various categories
nutritive substances are also present in vegetarian food materials
today many doctors and people consider consuming nonvegetarian food for protein and calorie due to misleading advertisements
but in many vegetarian food materials also protein calorie vitamins and nutritive substances are available in sufficient quantity
in nonvegetarian items lrb the outer part of pulses cereals etc rrb there is no quantity of fiber present at all
this has been ascertained by the scientists that fiber has lot of importance in preventing diseases
vitamins are also essential for our health
the source of these vitamins are vegetable substances only
the main source of food for animals and humans is the food obtained by agriculture or plants
the proteins which are found in meat those also are obtained from plants alone
therefore getting nutrition directly from vegetable substances is better than from that secondary nutrition which in animal meat has also been obtained from vegetable substances
some people spread this rumor that egg is complete nutrition
vitamin carbohydrates and fiber are not found at all in eggs
egg meat fish etc are acidic food due to which there is removal of calcium from the bones and due to this type of loss occurring of calcium it takes longer for the bone to rejoin after fracture
there is also more cholesterol in eggs
any type of toxic substance can not arise in balanced diet prepared by mixing fruits green vegetables various types of lentils seeds and milk
its main reason is that when an animal dies then it becomes dead substance
this does not apply to vegetables
if any vegetable is cut even half and its half part is put inside the ground then it will grow again in the form of vegetable or tree
this is possible only because vegetable is living substance
this thing can not be said for lamb goat or chicken
from the other special sources it has been found this that when an animal is killed then it becomes afraid and the toxic substance released due to fear sprears in his body
that same toxic substance reaches the body of those people in the form of meat who eat them
our body is not completely capable of excreting all those toxic substances
the acid base balance is essential in food
many doctors believe that the reason of disease in body is the imbalance of acidbase
it is such belief of doctors that in our body there are approximately percent are basic substances and approximately percent are acidic substances
but in our food attention is not paid on the ratio of acid base
it is the belief that in the peels of maximum fruits and vegetables generally there is more basic substance and in the inner part there is acidic substance more
therefore the doctors advice to eat the edible substances without removing the peels
but in the present times due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the consumption of cereals and vegetables without washing them properly and with peels may also become the reason of harm because of some part of poison remaining in them
the aim of saying is this only that instead of giving importance to one sided thought with respect to food we should take decision after thinking on every side with multiple point of view as per the weather and physical needs
but in no case the natural doctrines of nature should be ignored
according to chinese panch tatva doctrines various tastes have relations with different organs of the body
natural doctors have such beliefs that liver and pancreas are affected by sour taste
hot taste has relation with lungs and large intestine
sweet taste has direct relation with spleen and gall bladder
the heart and small intestines etc are affected by bitter taste
with these tastes not just our organs get affected but the nutrition of these organs also take place
the doctors consider the balance of taste in foood alone as the base of health
the doctors treat by balancing various tastes
the food should be according to the weather
those food materials which are obtained maximum from the nature in that month is generally considered to be good from the point of view of health
maximum birds animals which do not accumulate food and lead carefree life lead there life on the basis of available fruits leaves alone
the nature gives complete support in order to keep each person healthy
all the animals eat only those things which is available around them
animals do not import food materials from other places
the laws of nature are equal for every one poor and rich
therefore the consumption of expensive unseasonal imported food material is always useful for health is completely false
balanced diet itself does the work of medicine
such is the belief of dieticians that the relation of maximum physical diseases is due to food related ill habits carelessness and inattentiveness
the chief reason of this is our ignorance about right food greed for taste lack of timely thoughtfullness lack of prudence immoral conduct selfish point of view etc
in various medical methods attentiveness towards diet is an important part of treatment
in natural treatment diet only is given the maximum importance for health and treatment
according to the point of view of natural doctors and dieticians food alone is the medicine
tea is sweet poison
at present there is the custom of tea in all the houses
to the extent that the reception of guests is incomplete without tea
what are you drinking in the name of tea
what are you making your guests drink if they come to know of it even slightly then people will run away from having tea at house

the interesting thing is that there is hardly any judicial procedure and someone has been punished related to contamination in tea

sugar is white poison
one special thing has been said about sugar is that from the point of view of vitamins it does not have any type of speciality
sugar is only type of sweetness no type of nutritive substance is obtained from it
the heart is damaged by eating sugar
in one japanese doctor had researched on sugar
as result of the use of excess sugar the disease of hypoglucamia disease has spread in europe and america
in the patient suffering with hypoglucamia initially he feels physical weakness then there is false hunger and then sweating
the body of the patient at times starts shivering and he also becomes unconscious
the doctors have said that for this disease sugar only is responsible
due to sugar there is also type of indigestion and constipation
after the arrival of sugar in stomach it produces type of burning in stomach and intestines
this happens due to the acid produced during the digestion of sugar
the substances rich in sugar produce more acidity
the teeth are damaged due to sugar
in fact the acid which is produced from the sugar stuck to the teeth the damage to the teeth occurs due to that reason
the teeth of children eating fatty sweet substances like cake biscuit chocolate ice cream etc become bad and diseases fast
due to sugar skin diseases also occur such has been found from researches
headche and migraine disease occurs due to the reason of sugar and chocolate

in the imported cigarettes of famous companies is sugar only
remember we eat extra sugar through bottled drinks biscuits chocolates and canned fruits ice creams and sweets
how should the food be in rough cold
wrong food becomes the reason of cold in at least nine out of ten people
generally people eat anything that comes in front
people eat all types of things together
the question of food is extremely important for the patient of cold
chew the food very well and eat gradually
abiding by it is essential both for the patient as well as healthy
cold occurs due to the consumption of wrong food
wrong food produces more than expected indigestion
gas and acidity is produced by indigestion
later on poison is produced due to the rotting of food in the intestine
some portion of these undigested food gets absorbed by the blood because of which it becomes polluted and acidic
that blood travels in all the parts of the body and makes each corner diseased
when all the veins of blood and body become polluted then some or the other disease should definitely occur and often it gets manifested in the form of cold
be light eater in food
prepare the food very plain
eat fresh things sufficiently and abstain from pickle jelly chutney and canned food to the extent possible
eat milk cream and paneer in small qauntity
these are good things but the experience of the patients of cold is that due to their increased consumption the disease increases
in cold people of more age who eat many things they should not use milk for more than once in day
those whose eye color has become bad they should not eat cream or paneer till the time its color becomes clear
eat some fresh fruits and raw vegetables daily and certainly
the reason for the suggestion to use fresh fruit and raw vegetables is this that iron calcium carbonate soda etc essential natural minerals are obtained from them in such way in which the body needs them
fresh fruit and raw vegetables purify the body and they make the blood basic
it is essential for the blood to be basic
fruit and vegetable prevent the food from getting rotten in the intestine and this way also support in keeping the body disease free as well
meat or meat made food should not be eaten
in vegetarian food all types of meat and fish should also be counted
protein is required in order to maintain the body

maximum there should be four five things in meal
have food at fixed time

keep in mind that it is not important that every patient having pain in the upper part of the stomach should have ulcer or acidity
for the diagnosis of the symptoms of the deudenal ulcer of patient some laboratory tests are done after the extensive information and physical examination
in these tests stool tests endoscopy and borium ray are main
if the patient is consuming smoke alcohol pan masala then quitting them is extremely essential
to the extent possible escape from excessive mental tension and take rest as much as possible
eat food slowly after chewing it properly and the food to be eaten in two times should be taken four five times
any such type of food because of which the pain and discomfort of the patient increases do not take
by proper food and quitting intoxication the patient will get relief from the symptoms
do not consider this as sufficient but the complete healing of the food is also important because of which the symptoms do not occur again
for this take medication by staying in the vigilance of good doctor
why and how should high blood pressure be controlled
today consumerism tension and competitive life wrong eating habits lack of rest alone are the chief root of high blood pressure
this decreases and increases day night
on the development of blood pressure once it can stay for the entire life without any difference
in the world more than crore people have been registered as the patients of high blood pressure
finally this is also considered as the reason of heart attacks
because of persisitent high blood pressure continuous damage reaches to brain heart kidneys pancreas and reproductive organs
since it can not be felt continuously but it can bring the damage which can not be corrected
because of maintained high blood pressure it can produce stroke in the brain
which is considered as the most dangerous situation
excessively increased blood pressure tears the weak vessels after damaging them
consequently there is localized bleeding
it produces paralysis
similarly by increasing the pressure in blood vessels high blood pressure produces the stroke of heart
which creates permanent damage to the heart muscles because of which that portion becomes dead like and brings growth in the heart
because the above mentioned heart attack after creating lack of oxygen in the quantity obtained through the blood to the muscles of the heart produces pain in the chest which is called enzyna
if this resource of oxygen and blood becomes increasingly less then it would be called the stroke of heart
when the blood pressure starts increasing then the resource of blood in the rest of the organs decreases because of the increased accumulation of blood in the heart
the increased pressure within the heart damages the walls and the openings of the heart and produces tension
the high blood pressure affects the activity of blood purification after contracting the blood vessels
after its permanence the purification of blood becomes abnormal and becomes the reason of the infection of kidney and other disorders
since through the knidney the adverse substances for the body are removed daily post digestion through the urinary passage
but due to abnormal activity these substances return to the body again and make the body poisonous and become the reason of kidney failure
the increased pressure for long duration enhances the pressure in the blood vessel which take the blood to the retina and may even tear them
due to which the blood secretion occuring on the body may take away the eye sight permanently
with the increase of age the blood vessels lose the property of their flexibiity after becoming stiff
these stiff vessels are called vessel stiffness
due to these very arteries the high blood pressure create more dangers and make the situation extremely serious and damages heart brain kidney
due this very difficulty of artery some it also weakens the feet
for high blood pressure control consult the related doctor and get the tests done
in high blood pressure test lipid frofa blood urea blood sugar etc are done
after this as per the doctor advice are given as to which salt to use for food what exercise to take how to sleep etc
one should take permanent advice from his family doctor
do not change doctor and treatment again and again it always takes some time in controllig
if our weight is more than normal then we should decrease it immediately
do not take fried salty or fatty food or take it minimally
do not eat stomachfull or again and again
drink more cold water this water receives additional energy from the body and increases its consumption
avoid nonvegetarian food and if you eat then along with it eat only fruit and green vegetable and salad three times more
do not take wine tobacco cold drinks and junkfood etc
use unpeeled grains and lentils
one must walk kms everyday with speed in morning or in the evening
one must sit at least minutes for yoga and minutes for meditation
take full massage by going to naturopathy health center and take steam bath and anema as advised by the doctor
try to avoid unnecessary anxieties and tension

due to frequent blood donation such person might be weak and afflicted with different kinds of disease out of which some can even be deadly such as jaundice aids etc
the amount of iron in the person donating blood frequently might be much less than that of healthy person
because such person keeps on donating blood prior to the time of donating blood again due to economic compulsions
because of not taking nutritive food many types of diseases can occur to blood donator person
only when the use of blood is very essential then only blood donation should be done because on the occurrence of slight carelessness and reaction the life of the patient can go
because of unnecessary blood donation there is chance of suffering from other diseases in which jaundice aids reproductive diseases etc severe fatal diseases are included
the blood should always be used of reatives and friends about whom you have complete knowledge
if you have to get the surgery done on the definite date then you youself get your blood extracted before the surgery and have it kept to be used during the surgical process
there is no danger in having the blood extracted beforehand
in the modern times by using the various components of blood the demand for blood can be reduced
like the patient suffering from anemia should only be given red blood corpuscles and it is essential for the burnt person to be given plasme
therefore giving that category of blood which is according to the patient and is behavioural is beneficial

learn the difference between cholestrol and fat
fat can alone increase your weight but cholestrol alone can not increae your weight
in out of people the reason behind obesity is the presence of both the fat and the cholestrol
when the cholestrol is in the body in normal quantity then it plays an important role in keeping the artries of the heart healthy
it is very important for health that the cholestrol be in normal quantity
it is produced in the liver of our body by the nature
if there is too much cholestrol in the body then it leads to the disease aeksklerosis
in the aeksklerosis disease waxlike substance is secreted in the artries which makes them very narrow
due to this waxlike substance blood is not able to flow properly which leads to heart attack
hdl cholestrol is high density lipoprotein
its job is to clear the way of the blood flow such that the work of the heart mechanism goes on smoothly
we can call hdl cholestrol the good cholestrol
ldl cholestrol is low density lipoprotein
ldl cholestrol accumulates in the artries by combining with the fat which causes obstacle in the flow of the blood
due to the obstacle in the blood flow there is danger of heart disease
we can call ldl cholestrol the bad cholestrol
vegetable fat is unsaturated lipid
because of vegetable ghee and the process of organic hydrogenation vegetable oil takes the solid form in the room temperature
vegetable fat is not so harmful as saturated fat
as far as obesity is concerned both kinds of fat increases obesity
animal fat the fat found in all kinds of meat and milk products comes under this category
animal fat is saturated fat which means that it becomes solid from liquid at room temperature it increases the fat cells of our body which leads to increase in the weight
animal fat along with the bad cholestrol reduces the blood flow towards the mind and the heart
if you want to remain healthy then before having your food first see how much is the quantity of the cholestrol and the fat
endocrine glands have very important place in our body
when endocrine glands secrete in enough quantity then our helath remains perfect but in case of the opposite our health malfunctions hence it is compulsory for us to keep them healthy under any condition
because of these endocrine glands someone is found to be extremely small some tall some fat and some absolutely thin
eunuchs are also the result of the abnormality of these endocrine glands
sometimes you would have seen hairs on the face of the girls and boys without moustache and beards and would have heard of sex change all this is the result of the abnormality of the endocrine glands
it is clear from all this that secretion of the endocrine glands keep balance on our mental development internal and external activities and behavior etc
the hormone secreting from the pancreat gland is insulin
pancreat gland keeps control over the quantity of insulin
when the body has excessive glucose then the secretion of insulin converts into glucose and due to the lack of insulin diabetes occurs
thyroid glands are of the shape of the shield and they are situated in the throat on the both sides of the trachea
the hormone secreted from thyroid glands is called thyroxin and it controls the growth of the body and the rate of the heart beat
it is helpful in proper usage of carbohydrate
in case of deficiency of glucose in the body the secretion of thyroxin helps in the formation of glucose by separating carbohydarte from other substances and controls the quantity of calcium
in case of throxin becoming overactive phosphate along with calcium is lost from the bone and it begins to come in excretion and consequently the bones become thin and weak
parathroids are four in number and they are situated attached to the throid glands
the hormone secrted in it helps in keeping the optimum quantity of calcium and phosphate in the blood
its deficiency lead to tetanus calcium deficiency and increase in phosphorous
the secretion of liver and stomach removes the deficiency of blood
the secretion of liver and stomach increases the red blood cells in the blood
adrenal gland is also called suprarenal gland it is near the kidneys
every gland has two parts
the outer part is called adrenal cortex and the inner part is called adrenal almedula
the secretion of the outer part of the bordering kidney has great importance
the removal of outer part by operation causes immediate death
the outer part is essential for life
the sexual feelings are balanced by these hormones
due to more secretion than required untimely sexual development takes place
for example periods and complete development of sexual organs in years old girls
testes in the males and ovaries in the females are present in the form of sexual glands
we call the juice secreted by these sex glands the sex hormone and it is this which gives maleness to the males and femaleness to the females
pituitary gland is the part of the brain itself and it is very small in size
several types of hormones are produced by the pituitary gland
it is because of these hormones that the hormones secreted by the rest of the glands is produced in the right qunatity and their work is completely controlled
it is very necessary for the normal development
when these hormones do nt work properly then even the giantsized children could also be born
these hormones are very helpful in removing the dwarfism
the elements that develops then is produced in the front part of the pituitary gland
the secretion of these glands is chemical and their work is also to produce chemical effect
taking bath in cold water leads to the formation and the secretion of hormones within the body on time and in proper form
when these glands get live food then they do their work properly
use of fresh pure cold water is helpful in their secretion
therefore in order to improve the chemical work of these glands we should take the complete chemical elements obtained by unripe food whether you take it in the form of water by taking the juice or just the unripe food in itself
because of the use of cold water the glands secrete properly by becoming strong and fired up
the property of unripe food is also cold and that of acidic ripe potato hot
therefore unripe food is necessary for the proper development and secretion of these glands
besides these endocrine glands dineal gland and thymous gland also have an important place
sufficient secretion by pineal gland leads to proper secretion and development of sexual glands and it is also helpful in the mental development
because of the proper secretion of thymous gland sexual maturity comes on time
it is necessary to know about the deficiency signs of the endocrine glands so that the related glands could be fired up
when absorption and release process of carbohydrate could not take place completely due to the deficiency of insulin then diabetes occurs
in case of deficiency of thyroxin along with obesity and goitre the absorption of iron could not take place sufficently
in case of deficiency of secretion by the sexual gland there is lack of maleness and femaleness
in case of deficiency of secretion by pituitary gland alongwith dwarfism strength also diminishes and complete inaction could even lead to death
in case of deficiency of secretion by pineal gland there is an untimely development of sexual maturity and there is an improper mental development
in case of deficiency of secretion by thymous gland the development of sexual organs is not proper and complete
in case of deficiency of secretion by the adrenal gland the life force diminishes and in complete inaction could even lead to death
in this way the proper understanding of the indications caused by the deficiency of secretion is very helpful in removing the deficiency
cytica is disease of nerves
in the inner portion of the body cytica nerve is long nerve in comparison to the others
coming out of the lower end of the spine it has gone towards the leg from behind the ankles
the pain which it causes is called cytica
this pain originates at the back and sometimes spread till the toe of the leg
but generally the pain is caused by the part of this very nerve
it is always limited at the back side
the pain of cytica is very painful and it can be compared to the pain of the toothache
this disease generally remains from several weeks to several months and in difficult circumstamces it can carry on till several years
cytica occurs due to cold residence in damp place paralysis of the muscles and constipation etc
when due to these reasons the blood flow becomes poisonous and the cytica nerve becomes agitated by this poison and swelling appears in it then this disease appears
therefore in many areas cytica is called kind of neuritis
sometimes as result of an injury to the lower portion of the spine the cytic nerve is affected causing this disease
it is said that this condition arises by standing or walking for long time bending suddendly picking up heavy weight etc
in cytica disease it is extremely important to make the patient healthy along with the local treatment
for this it is specially important to pay attention towards the methodology
but now because of the emergence of different diseases and allergies by the use of artificial resources people have begun to give importance to the natural alternative
it is necessary to give special attention towards the formation of acidaccumulation in the patient body
in many situations this disease appears bcause of the decrease in acid
if one can fast one day before the treatment then the patient is sufficiently benefitted
in all the old diseases one should fast in some form
the body gets cleansed by fasting
other dietary methods are similar to mental weakness

generally instead of taking the ready made herbal or natural beauty products available in the market if we prepare it in the home in consultation with qualified herbal specialist then it is better
although in the busy life this is definitely little difficult for every woman or man yet it is the best

so the guarnatee of the color and oneness of the products in every batch can not be given
but there is no reduction in the effectiveness of the products because of our dependence on the nature

it would have happened with you that some name might have been there in your mind but that does not come to your tongue
sometime you forget after keeping the keys somewhere
it is believed by the zoologists that even behind this incomplete memory of the humans also there is motive
some people are unwavering in their belief that if we want permanent impression of knowledge then it is necessary that our memory be incomplete

everything would have gone awry by the memory of smaller events therefore it is good that we remember only the important things
healthy mind exists in healthy body
if your age is more than forty years and exercise four or five times week then surely you could beat in memory that person of your age who do nt exercise
if you do nt exercise regularly then leave your laziness now
the wonderful tonic for the mind is the exercise

whatever happens is not completely independent from the other events
pay attention to these events
very easily the description of any particular event will begin to flash in the mind
if the mind does not cooperate even then such facts could be searched in any book of general knowledge
by combining the events sequentially in this way many times our mind begins to think in the right direction

but some physicians have called swelling of membrane ramada hakiki whether it is produced by cold or heat
according to famous unani hakim sheikh bualisini ramada is of two types
one ramada hakiki and other ramada majaji
certain other unani hakims have told of three and four divergences of ramada
when you sweat on roaming in sun then some drops going in eyes produce irritation
there is burning sensation and itching in eyes by sweat
when someone scratches with force then eyes become red
swelling arises in eyes by brightness of sunlight
during teething in little children eye start paining
eyes start paining sooner with blood defect
disease of eyes occurs much by eating strong red chilly sour things and drinking much tea and coffee drinking alcohol

many times woman is affected by some such sexual diseases that she feels hesitation in consulting any doctor for the treatment
woman affected by sexual disease however can consult lady doctor for the treatment of the disease
because of the less number of lady doctors their service is not available everywhere
because of this such women face the pain of those common sexual disease for long time which can be treated easily
in order to achieve success in the treatment of the women sexual diseases it is necessary that lady doctor maid nurse or any doctor should first of all check and test the genitals of the patient
in order to achieve excellence and become specialist in the disease of the women you keep complete record of the woman disease on thick printed card which is called history sheet
first of all you write down the previous diseases and problems lrb which she tells rrb of the woman patient who has come to you
writing down the problems and symptoms of the woman helps lot in diagnosing the basic lrb real rrb reason of the disease
for how long is this disease and problem there
when and how did the suffering started
in which season by which reasons which time or which food etc do this disease and suffering increase or decrease
if it is possible and available then also try to know the medicines by which the disease decreases

sometime difference occurs in the order of the menstruation which is called epimenorrhea
sometime change related to the decrease or increase in the quantity of blood occurs
when the female patient complains of the symptoms of bleeding or there is some suspicion regarding such symptoms then one should confirm the bleeding at the right time
even little lapse or carelessness of the doctor understanding the blood coming from vagina urethra or anus as an irregular bleeding instead of providing benefits to the health of the patient you can cause harm
it can even lead to the wrong treatment
if it becomes known that bloodloss was from uterus then its relation should be deduced from the menstruation cycle pregnancy and during the pregnancy and abortion
because of the excess of bleeding anemia could arise in the patient which is called the second hemorhhage
in such situation it should also be enquired from the patient whether lumps of blood have also formed
what has been the color of the lost blood
whether this color is the same as that of the blood of the period or of different color
it is necessary to ask all these questions from the patient
one should note the date of the last period
after listening to the complete description by the patient and writing it in the history sheet one should carry out her physical examination
under this first of all one should carefully look at the face and the body of the patient to see whether there is deficiency of blood
also examine the teeth of the patient carefully and see if there is any cavity in the teeth and if pus or blood is coming out of the gums
also ascertain whether her brain and muscles are weak through conversation with the patient
one should also look at the collar bone near both the shoulders to confirm whether there is any difference between them
besides these also see whether the patient has become obese because of the accumulation of excessive fat
after this one should test the stomach and abdomen of the patient
while testing instruct the patient that she breathe slowly with open mouth
then the doctor should apply the pressure softly on each part of the belly by spreading her palms and keeping the hand on the belly of the patient softly
before examining the lower part of the abdomen by touching one should also grope to check whether the parts like liver gall bladder spleen and kidneys have become bigger or not
whether the patient feels any problem while touching or pressing these body parts

in the case of flatulence and gastric sound like that of drum comes on being tapped
in case of the formation of hard lump in the belly on being tapped it seems that there is some hard object beneath
on having contracted water filled lump the finger feels the pressure of the liquid
in case of water formation in the belly on being tested by the tapping method the finger feels the pressure of the water
if the patient is pushed on the left side by the hand then the hand on the right side will clearly feel the ripple of the water
if there is water in the belly then the position of water also changes with the change in the situation of the patient
if the patient stands up then the lower portion of the belly becomes big by swelling because of the water coming down
on lying on the left side water comes on the left side

those women on whose abdomen there are thin whitish lines then it is an indication of the fact that she has miscarried earlier also
the place where there is pain and problem on pressing the belly it should be ascertained which body part is beneath that place

these waves can not be heard
the speed of the ultrasound waves used for the medical purposes is very less in comparison to the waves used for other purposes
every wave of the ultrasound can go ahead come back or can even get absorbed there itself
probe produces waves per second
the life cycle of one wave is very small so there is big difference between two waves
during this time the probe catches the sound waves sent back by the body
the knowledge of any kind of problem in the body is known by the duration that sound takes in going to that part and coming back and the study of the picture formed on the screen
basically it is very difficult to understand the behavior of the sound and for that computer is needed

generally questions about right food is being asked in the reiki seminar

because how can an ill body help someone else
on the basis of lifeenergy there is no difference in the body of humans and animals
the principal elements of lifeenergy are air sun water and earth
our body becomes ill by the imbalance of these basic elements itself
this lifeforce is comletely balanced in the plants and trees
this lifeforce could taken visibly in the form of food
plants vegetables and cereals are the natural reserves of these forces
this lifeforce reserve remains present in them for quite long time even after they are cooked
this way when the person eats vegetables etc pulses and cereals then he takes in the visibly available lifeforce present in them
that is why it is living food
besides this when we are in condition of fear anxiety conflict prejudice then biochemical changes happen in our body which spreads in our body in the form of poison
this poison affects our body with different kinds of diseases
similarly when person kills an animal for food then at that time that animal is overpowered by fear and biochemical changes happen in his whole body very quickly
this poison in the form of chemical spreads in his whole body

the consequences for the persons who indulge in intoxication is generally serious
intoxication always ends in mental depression itself
the effect of intoxication is always negative on the body
slowly the important parts of body goes on becoming inoperable
the main element of solar plexus is fire and liquor which itself is fire element completely destroys the solar plexus
along with heart chakra closes by shrivelling which in itself is fearsome situation
whether intoxication is of liquor or some other intoxicant material the result is of simialr kind
similarly the intoxication of cigarrette biri is also of the same kind whose consequences are not good
slowly solar plexus begins to shrivel which gives rise to many stomach related problems
the smoke coming out of cigarrette slowly keeps on obstructing the aura
the smoke coming out of biri stops the pure and fresh life force coming from outside and slowly all the chakra keeps on getting affected

sugar sweets chocolate bottled packeted drinking material are prepared by different chemicals
these edible materials prepared by different kinds of chemicals is dangerous for our health
there is no nutrition in these edible materials at all
in the race for modernity the level of knowledge has come so low that people have made these products an inseparable part of their life
sugar is kind of acid because it is prepared with the help of acid itself
this acid produces many kinds of diseases in our body
among which the principal ones are ulcer arthritis problems of kidney skin disease insomnia and disinterest towards the study of children etc
those people who have mental depression and epilepsy they should shun sugar and products made up of sugar
similarly chocolate harms the children the most

although in the west people have almost shunned milk but in india milk has remained the synonym for good health
therefore any argument against it would not be acceptable to the common man
even though it is important to tell in its relation that the milk of animal is meant for the animals
child can drink one mother milk till the age of three years
because till the age of three years those chemicals lrb rennin and lactose rrb are there in the child body which could digest the milk
that is it dissolves the element lrb casein rrb that is found in the milk
but after the age of three years these chemicals lrb rennin and lactose rrb end automatically and then the element lrb casein rrb found in the milk is not able to get digested and slowly keeps on accumulating in the intestine
in order to clean up this material mucous is created in large quantity and slowly it gives rise to many diseases
if you are suffering from diseases like tonsil bronchitis then immediately stop the milk
in reality the calcium found in the milk is itself the main reason behind many diseases
the large quantity of phosphorous in milk forces the blood to extract calcium from the healthy bones and teeth of the body
the calcium found in the milk produces an excess of calcium in the blood which creates tumor cataract stone in the kidneys and gall bladder
the calcium found in the milk gives rise to common diseases like problems of bones spondilitis sciatica etc
cough and cold sinusaitis epistaxis and hay fever etc are among the major disease of nose
cough and cold occurs by the bacteria which is always present in upper respiratory tract

similar glands situated towards the upper portion of throat in the way of wind pipe are called adenoids or pharyngeal tonsils
tonsil has very important role in keeping the body diseasefree
as soon as the germs try to enter into the body through the way of mouth tonsil terminates them
in this way tonsil protects the body from many diseases
tonsil is also helpful in the formation of the white blood cells

similarly the patients of slipped prolapsed disc is also increasing everyday
mainly people think that the disc has come out by getting shaken
when because of excessive work or some other reason there is no full natural expansion no speed or rupture happens in the disc then pressure begins to fall on the nerves
the capaciy of the spinal cord in the advancing age picking up weight more than the strength or picking up in wrong way leads to slipped prolapsed disc

this pain is generally felt in one leg and that too generally one the outer side of the leg

the information about diabetes is there in china greece and india since ancient times itself from where it reached other countries
the quantiy of urine in the situation of diabetes increases from three times to twelvethirteen times of that of normal situation

the most painful aspect of the joints and bones diseases is that in the condition of the increase in disease deformity appears in many body parts
due to the occurrence of deformity in the joints and bones the patients are not able to walk and neither are they able to do any work with ease
one doctor from america had written in his book that man has reached on the moon but he does not have any cure for joint inflammation
one should go to the nature itself for the treatment of this disease
reiki is the best solution for the joints and bones diseases
in order to give motion to the body there are several joints of bones which are called joints
except skull all other bones of the body are mobile
arthritis is the disease related to these very joint of bones
ligaments do the job of keeping these bones connected among themselves
besides these some fluid materials continuously keep the surface of the bones lubricated due to which the speed of the joints remain natural and easy and while moving they do not have any kind of pain
there are sacs of liquid material near many joints which is called bursae
in the joint inflammation diseases in addition to the swelling of joints there is an increase in the temperature of the body
muscles tendons and nerves are also affected
in this disease the blood vessels related to synovial membrane becomes flat from normal shape
these blood vessels get more supply of blood than earlier due to which protein present in the blood and some other fluid material get accumulated around the joints through the blood vessels
due to this swelling occurs in the joints
when the blood vessels collide with the joints then there is pain
those people who take more than to hours in the digestion they have greater possibilty of contracting this disease
in addition to this those people in whose blood there is large quantity of acid and calcium materials arthritis disease is seen in them also
those people who take excessive wine and beer and take lot of nutritious food and do not exercise their liver and kidneys are not able to work properly they contract arthritis disease
in many people arthritis disease is paternal also
rheumatoid arthritis is seen three times in women in comparison to men
many doctors opine that rheumatoid arthritis especially affects the people living in colder places
small viruses could also become the reason behind rheumatoid arthritis
rheumatoid arthritis disease generally starts slowly
in the beginning rheumatoid arthritis disease attacks the hannds and the legs
sometime in rheumatoid arthritis there is pain only in the knees
according to the symptoms while waking up in the morning there is greater stiffness in the body parts and as the afternoon comes in pain and stiffness decreases
slowly this disease reaches the fingers of hands and legs elbows arms hips knees and ankles
in rheumatoid arthritis the fingers and hands and legs begin to become curved and stiff
if this disease is not treated properly then heart and lungs could also be adversely affected
osteoarthritis generally this disease affects the people of middle age
the symptoms of osteoarthritis is specially seen in the women
those women in whom this disease is seen more their menstruation ceases completely
osteoarthritis disease genrally affects fat people
in osteoarthritis those joints are affected more on which the weight of the body falls spinal cord kness and hips
gout generally this disease affects men
gout disease genrally affects the men above the age of years
in women this disease is very rarely seen
doctors are of the view that when some special protein elements purinis is not able to digest properly then this element is transformed into uric acid
the crystals of uric acid begin to accumulate specially in joints and kidneys and skin
the crystals of uric acid sharp and stinging like needles
gout starts suddenly
in people gout starts from the joint of the thumb of the first leg
according to the dosctors vitaminc is an extremely miraculous medicine
along with it the patient should drink water in greater quantity and should eat fresh and green vegetables
along with it the patient is benefitted moraculously by doing reiki and with continuous treatment gout is treated completely
while doing reiki the patient will feel that the disease is completely cured after threefour days but after that he will feel it again but after this the disease will be cured slowly
in this disease reiki is to be given at the whole body
reiki should be given for longer time on centres like solar plexus liver spleen ajna chakra throat chakra etc
the importance of ajna chakra is maximum from among the different chakras situated in our body
ajna chakra is situated in the middle of our head in the middle of both the eyebrows
it is also referred to as the third eye of shiva
this story is famous in the puranas
it is by opening this third eye lord shankar had produced the agni tejas and with that the disturbing kamdeva was burnt into ashes
damyanti had protected her modesty from the tiger by producing the magnanimous fire flame from the third eye
from both these stories it is concluded that ajna chara is extremely important for us
sanjay had been able to get divine vision only by the development of the third eye
as result of the third eye sanjay had begun to see all the scenes of mahabharta war as in television
in the eyes of some people special kind of attraction is found
special electronic waves flow through their eyes
this elctronic wave affects in both good and bad ways
the incident of catching bad eye is common this idea seems like superstition but there is scientific fact in this idea and the reason behind this is this very electronic wave
these electronic waves have great impact on our life
in the defensive look of eyes both good and bad kinds of elements are included whose effect could be used in the desired direction
these electronic waves could be sharpened even more by reiki
was becoming weaker day by day
doctor told me that there is infection in my lungs
did not panic as had already learned reiki
did not take any medicine only did reiki
in about days had become completely healthy
generally husband wife consider pregnancy chance incident while it is not completely true
there is necessity to spread worldwide awareness about the safe time for pregnancy
in the absence of this awareness one third children and two lacs mothers become the victim of death every year
it could be stopped if we know the safe time for pregnancy and instead of considering it chance incident we know that pregnancy occurs only according to the wishes of the husband wife
what is maternal death
in pregnancy if during child birth or within six weeks of child birth if the woman dies then it is called maternal death
it is definite that if the information regarding safe pregnancy and contraception techniques could reach the people then maternal mortality rate could be brought down heavily
mother could also be freed of different kinds of diseases
the meaning of lowering of mortality rate is the preservation of family healthy nutrition and happiness in the society
the duration of procreation life of any woman is from the age of thirteen years to forty five years
but any woman is not always suitable for procreation
the best period for pregnancy is from twenty to thirty years of age
in this scientific age the medical science has developed so much that we have begin to understand the importance of the health of the child being brought up in the womb
the age of procreation capability of woman is generally accepted as years
the first five years and the last ten years of the procreation capability of women life is full of risk
if the common man could understand the terrible consequences of these years of procreation then the long duration of procreation would come down to years from years
that means from the age of years to years
this will automatically give strength to the family planning program
most of the have this illusion that the sex of the child depends on the mother which is wrong
the ovum of the woman has only one kind of chromosomes lrb xx rrb
the seeds of man lrb sperm rrb have two types of chromosomes lrb xy rrb
by the fusion of one of woman and one chromosome of man daughter lrb xx rrb and by the fusion of one of woman and one of woman son lrb xy rrb is born
thus birth of son or daughter depends on their father and not on their mother
now days the services related to the tests during pregnancy in the antenatal of hospitals and before pregnancy and marriagerelated advice in the pregnancy clinics have been started
there should be difference of at least three years between two children
the health of mother could also become suitable for the second child not before this
in young age at the age of less than to years if there is abortion then many complexities increase
that is why it is said that before becoming pregnant it is necessary that girl becomes complete woman
because of the pregnancy in young age girls become physically and mentally weak
in young age the girls are not so mature as to handle all the responsibilities of mother
in them incidents of spontaneous abortion and termination of pregnancy happen more
due to abortion the dangers related to it are also there like anemia infection excessive bloodloss etc
along with pregnancy in the young age increase in blood pressure and loss of blood from body and presence of protein in urine are also found
because of pregnancy in young age deficiency in blood occurs and child birth is also painful
during child birth the natural pain meaning labor pain is not proper
because of improper development of the hip bone and the womb there is need for surgery
because of pregnancy in young age often the child is born prematurely
the child remains ill because of incomplete development
sometimes because of the pregnancy in young age the child even dies
after the pregnancy in young age the infants are mostly very weak and their mortality rate is also greater
after the pregnancy in young age often the mother becomes victim of mental diseases
sometimes the stress increases to such level that mother commits suicide
bing mother in advanced age meaning after years of age is also extremely dangerous
the maximum fertility strength of woman is in the age of years which slowly decreases
in the age of forty years there is very little pregnancy
in advanced age the chances of abortion also increase by pregnancy
in advanced age blood pressure increases and the chances of heart disease increases with pregnancy
in advanced age the effect of blood impurity increases during conception to pregnancy
in advanced age there is greater chance of vomiting because of pregnancy or blood loss during pregnancy
in advancing age often excrescence forms in the womb
this excrescence produces pain during pregnancy and causes obstacles during child birth
due to which child birth is done through surgery and not naturally
the labor pain starts before the scheduled time and the birth of child also takes place before scheduled time
with the advancing age there is an effect on the elasticity of the joints also and many time times placenta is also retained
with the increase in the need for more surgery the danger for surgeons could also increase
in the children born in advanced age there is an expansion of the innate defects
most of the children are born with innate physical defects like organfractures or limb disorder
the innate physical defects of the children are also called mangol triguna sutrata
with advancing age sometimes the child dies in the womb itself
the incident of still born is thrice more in the middle ages pregnancy
dangers are not only in the pregnancy during young age or advanced age rather excessive pregnancy meaning if there are four or more children then there is great increase in the mortality rate
many types of danger also arise because of excessive pregnancy
during pregnancy development of the child takes place in the womb of the mother itself
the elements which are required for the formation of human body the child is dependent on the body of the mother for all that
it could be easily understood that during pregnancy there is deficiency of many important elements in the mother body
among these the main elements are iron calcium and protein
during the period of breast feeding the child also the mother need of calcium and protein is almost double of the normal
deficiency of blood could also be lethal
the woman does not get opportunity to give complete meal to her body and make it healthy
because of deficiency in hemoglobin percentage deficiency of calcium occurs in the body
as consequence of the deficiency of calcium occurrence of ostomellisia is possible
during pregnancy during child birth or after child birth excess blood loss
there is also the danger of bursting of womb because of the deficiency of nutritious elements
in womb there are more incidents of twin children and placenta process
after child birth some women have so much of blood loss that they die
because of the deficiency of protein in women the immunity of the body decreases
because of the low immunity the mother easily becomes victim of other diseases
the mother could be mentally satisfied and happy only when she is physically healthy
mother happiness has deep impact on the mental health of the child
mother becomes weak because of frequent pregnancy neither is she able to carry the extra burden of child fostering nor can she remain happy
if the difference between two children is not of two years then the probability of the death of the child increases by fifty per cent
the information of some mothers regarding pregnancy is either incomplete or is based on some superstitions
the mothers who are victim of the superstitions believe that till the first child is breast feeding she could not become pregnant
in reality becoming pregnant and breast feeding the child there is no scientific relation between these two
the mobile health centres may contact the mothers in the villages show them some such documentary films which could remove their ignorance
some couple do not use the contraceptive techniques of family planning
these outer means seem to be like obstacle in the way of the pleasure at that moment
such couples are kindly requested to go to the nearest health center and get complete information in this regard
so that the marital bliss is also maintained and they could also get information regarding the right time of pregnancy
now that time has come when scientific development has eased lot of problems but for this the couple should take advice from their doctor without any hesitation
it is mostly seen that little educated people out of shame neither tell the whole thing to the doctor nor they are able to ask anything
but there is nothing bad in getting complete information even if that is related to the right time of pregnancy
you should also have the information related to the infant
there is bad effect on the child in the womb in case of pregnancy on an inappropriate time
the weight of the child born fully mature is gram
for the child to develop completely it is necessary to remain in the womb of the mother for weeks
if the weight of the infant is less or is born before the weeks then he will be weak and there will always be fear of his being ill
those children whose weight is less than gram and length less than at the time of birth their parts of head and stomach are relatively big
if there is incomplete development of bones then its effect is also there on the internal organs of the body
lot of times lungs are not able to expand completely because of incomplete development of the respiratory system and the weakness of their muscles consequently they have deficiency of oxygen
there is bad effect on the development of the body because of the deficiency of oxygen
as result of this these children remain quite close to diseases or death
following diseases are frequently found in such types of children like asthma breathing problem secretion of blood in the brain unconsciousness the disease of jaundice etc
there is probability of getting relief from all these diseases and problems by pregnancy at the right time
after the birth of healthy child there is less difficulty in his nurturing and there is also great gain in his physical and mental development
good health is the base of all happiness
who is healthy
if one all three doshas vata pitta and kapha are balanced then he is healthy
if the seven elements maintaining the body juice blood flesh fat skeleton marrow and virility are in appropriate ratio then that person is healthy
besides this if the process of excretion happens in proper way and the ten senses lrb ears nose eyes skin taste anus genitalia hands legs and tongue rrb mind and their master soul is also happy then such person is also called healthy
for the attainment of health diet sleep and celibacy are the three pillars
this body is supported on these three bases itself
one whose diet pleasure thought and behavior are balanced and controlled he is yogi
one in whose work there is divinity there is always purity and longing for wellbeing in the mind whose sleeping and waking up is regular only he is the true yogi
person body is formed by the diet
diet has great effect not only on the body but also on the mind
in relation to the diet an illustration by maharishi charaka is very elegant
once upon time maharishi chakra asked his disciples who is healthy
the one who has food which is beneficial in proper quantity and in consonance with weather is healthy
know your nature lrb vaata pitta kapha rrb and take the food accordingly
if it is vaata nature there is air defect in the body then shun gassy food like rice etc and sour food
one should continue using small dried catkins dry ginger etc
those with pitta nature should not take hot fried products
raw food like long gourd pumpkin cucumber etc are beneficial
those with kapha nature should not take cold food rice curd buttermilk etc should not take in excess quantity
one should take milk by mixing small dry catkins turmeric etc in it
food should be taken in appropriate quantity
half of the stomach is for food keeping onefourth for the drinks it is appropriate to leave the rest for the air
by taking the food by matching it according to the season diseases do not come near
food taken at wrong time produces illness by causing indigestion
in the morning in between eight to nine it is good to take light drink fruit etc
the less the use of food in the morning the better it is for the body
it is better if the people of above fifty years do not take praataraasha
it is best to take food in the forenoon from eleven to twelve oclock
the time from twelve to one is medium after the time is successively bad
in the evening the time from seven to eight is best time from eight to nine is medium and after nine it becomes successively bad
due to talking during eating the food could not be chewed well and more food is also eaten
therefore while taking food one should keep quiet by remembering lord rama and eat the food by chewing well
mouthful should be chewed thirty two times or at least twenty times
one also gets freedom from violent thoughts by eating by chewing because we all know that when someone is angry the person begins to grinds his teeth
the origin of anger is teeth
if we want to end the violent feelings then we should pay special attention to chewing while eating
you will yourself experience the chewing of food then you will become aware of its results
one should do three rinse in the beginning of meal by remembering om or reciting mantras like gayatri mantra
one should not drink water in the middle of the meal
if the food is surly then one could drink little water
do nt drink more than twothree sips of water after the meal
if there is buttermilk then one should drink it
there is shloka in sanskrit which implies one who takes breakfast in the morning drinks milk after dinner at the night and drinks buttermilk after lunch in the noon he does not need doctor
means that person remains healthy
along with this our meal should be completely appropriate for us
there should be abundant mineral salt and vitaminb in the meal
meat eggs etc should not be used in the meal
god has made us vegetarian
when we can survive by eating roti in which there is no violence then what is the need of ending the dear life of any organism by killing it
it is better to die than live like this
humanely qualities like kindness compassion empathy love affinity and devotion etc end by eating meat
nonvegetarian human roams like demon
the stomach of nonvegetarian is like the cremation ground
sleep is in itself is complete pleasant sensation
if person could not sleep then he can also become insane
from outside sleep does not seem anything but those who are not able to sleep only they know what its importance is
sleep of hours is enough for healthy person
for young boys and old people it is appropriate to sleep for eight hours
sleeping early in the evening and waking up early in the morning makes the life of person improved
god has bound the nature in such rules that in the evening humans and other such creatures animals birds begin to take rest at their respective places
barring owl bat etc all other birds get engaged in their work by remembering god as soon as the dawn arrives
the cock gives the message of not sleeping during the dawn
birds are seen eulogising the name of god with beautiful songs
unfortunate human wakes up throughout the night like an owl and keeps lying down without taking the pleasure of this dawn
in the end the humans become ill
we should also take inspiration from dumb animals
sleeping early and waking up early makes the person healthy and great
the way diet is necessary to carry this body similarly there is extreme necessity of asanapranayama exercise etc
without exercise the body becomes ill and watery and dull
while by doing exercise regularly even weak ill and ugly person becomes strong healthy and handsome
the main reason behind heart disease diabetes obesity rheumatism gastric blood pressure mental stress etc is also the lack of exercise
if we exercise regularly then we could never get affected by these diseases
there are many types of exercise also
among all these asanapranayama is the best
in other exercises there is definitely physical work but concentration and peace does not come to the mind
by doing heavy exercise only muscles are exercised
by doing heavy exercise nerves are not exercised
therefore by heavy exercise the muscles become so hard that slowly bloodflow stops in them and pain begins
while with asanapranayama there is complete health benefit and there is no loss of any kind
along with body concentration and peace develops in the mind
after asana etc one should take bath after the temperature of the body becomes normal
by bathing freshness comes to the body the unwanted heat is satiated and the body becomes pure and light
body becomes pure by water
mind becomes pure by truth
soul becomes serene by learning and penance and mind by knowledge
except the ill people normal people should take bath with cold water
diseases like weak digestion and weakvision etc may occur by taking bath with the hot water
hair begin to gray and fall untimely
unnecessary heat increases in the body to cause the reduction of minerals
the body should be rubbed well by khadi towel after bathing
this increases radiance
if there is constipation then stomach should also be rubbed with the dry towel
if one could bath by swimming in river pond etc then it is the best
the people having desire for pleasure peace and happiness should meditate on god pray everyday for at least minutes to one hour after completing the daily activities like toilet bathing asana etc
the recitation of pranav and gayatri mantra etc for long time and with devotion gives extreme strength peace and pleasure
after the attainment of asana the controlling of speed of breathing process as per your capability is called pranayama
according to the yogadarshana there are four kinds of pranayama bahyavritti abhyantarvritti stambhvritti bahyabhyantar vishayakshepi
in the bahyavritti pranayama procedure exhale the breathe as per your strength by sitting in siddhasana or padmasana as per the procedure
after exhaling keep the breath outside by applying mulabandha uddiyaana bandha and jalandhara bandha as per your strength
when there is desire to take breath then then take the breath slowly by removing the bandhas
taking the breath inside do the breathing process as before without stopping
this way one can do this process to times
the process of bahyavritti pranayama is harmless pranayama
the fickleness of mind is cured by bahyavritti pranayama
the digestive fire is illuminated by jathragni pranayama
bahyavritti pranayama is beneficial in the abdominal diseases
the intellect becomes meticulous and sharp by bahyavritti pranayama
bahyavritti pranayama is the purifier of the body
bahyavritti pranayama frees one of wet dreams premature ejaculation etc mineral diseases by moving semen vertically up
in the abhyantarvritti pranayama process inhale as much breath as possible after exhaling it by sitting in meditative asana
the chest would be protruded outside and the lower portion of the stomach would be shrunken inside
apply jalandhara bandha and mulabandha by filling in the breath
keep the breath inside as per your strength
when there is desire to exhale then slowly bring out the breath by removing jalandhara bandha
abhyantarvritti pranayama frees one of all defects related to the lungs
abhyantarvritti pranayama is extremely beneficial for the patients of asthma
abhyantarvritti pranayama increases strength radiance and vigor in the body
in the stambhavritti pranayama process one has to stop breath here and there
stop the breath as per your strength and exhale
again on becoming normal stop it randomly
in stambhavritti pranayama all the three bandhas could be applied

there are many similarities in the eco system of the earth and our body
the way the development of human civilisation has taken place along with the presence of water similarly the physiology of our body is completely dependant on water
actually the human body is made up of water as per nature
water is found from human cells to bones muscles and blood
how much water is necessary for which part of the body this is controlled by the endocrine system present in the body
the responsibility of taking the nutrients and the waste products of the body from one place to the other in systematic manner is only of the water
first of all our mind is affected by the deficiency of water or bad quality of the water

when the natural shine of the skin begins to diminish because of the deficiency of water then wrinkles begin to appear on the skin
the elasticity of the skin also begins to be lost by the skin remaining dry for the long time

on reaching this point the cells of the skin begins to hang in the form of wrinkles by leaving its naturalness
in order to give healthy form to the skin it is necessary that it is nourished by those products which nourishes the skin by making proper balance of the water

stomach is situated in between the oesphagus and intestines
abdomen is present in almost all the organisms
human stomach is an elastic muscular pearshaped bag which is situated in the blank space across abdomen below the diaphragm
abdomen changes its shape and type according to the condition of the body itself
abdomen is about inch lrb cm rrb rrb long and inch wide lrb cm rrb at its most stretched point
the capacity of the abdomen in an adult is fudge lrb litre rrb
the food comes to the stomach through oesophagus
the contact point of oesophagus and abdomen are called lower oesophageal or gastro estro oesophageal sphincter
this sphincter in the abdomen stops the food from going back into the oesophagus
after the food reaches into the stomach gastric juice is used for the fragmentation of the food
some materials are absorbed by the muscule lining of the abdomen
wine is included in those materials whose absorption takes place in the abdomen itself
the other part of the abdomen dudaenum remains empty
dudaenum is the first part of the small intestine
pyleric sphincter separates the stomach from the dudaenum
abdomen is made up of five layers
if we look towards outside from the internal part then the most internal first layer is called mucosa
the formation of acidic and digestion juice takes place in the mucosa
the layer after this is called submucosa
in the emty condition the abdomen shrinks and mucosa and submucosa fold which is called ruge
when the food comes in it then ruge expands again
submucosa is surrounded by musculeris lrb that layer of muscle which the edible products get in the abdomen and produces speed in them rrb
the other two layers subsirosa and sirosa does the job of wrapping the abdomen in one way
sirosa is the most outer layer of the abdomen
if the internal lining of the abdomen is seen by the lens then it could be seen that it is covered by several small holes
these small holes are the doors of gastric pits which is spread straight and in the form of branched tubewell till mucosa
these small holes of the internal lining of the abdomen forms the gastric glands
mainly four kinds of secreting epihelium cells cover the abdominal surface and elaborated or spread till gastric pits and glands
mucous cells secrete basic mucous which saves the epithelium with excessive stress and acid
parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid or if said in simple terms then acid
main cells secrete pepsin lrb which is protiolytic enzyme for the fragmentation of protein rrb
cells secrete the gastrine hormone
because of the basic mucous layer lrb internal layer rrb of the abdomen the abdominal walls are saved from burning by the acid secreted by parietal cells
before entering the food into the stomach the food is brought into the shape by the mouth and mixed into the saliva by chewing
abdomen carries out the four basic works which helps in the primary stages of the diestion
these four works of food prepares the food for the processing by the intestines
the abdomen works as long term reservoir in which the food could be taken in large quantity and they could be used for long time by stroing them
it is the abdomen itself where the digestion with chemical and enzymes is started especially that of protein
the quick shrinking of gastric muscls is helpful in mixing the food with the gastric secreted materials
as result of this the food converts into liquid material in the stomach which prepares it for entering into the small intestine
as soon as the food converts into liquid material in the stomach it enters into the small intestine for further procesing
ulcer is an open wound or boiler which is found on the normal skin or the mucous membrane region of the body
the ulcer present in the lining of stomach or dusenum lrb where hydrochloric acid or pepsin is present rrb is called peptic ulcer
when this ulcer occurs in the stomach then it is called gastric ulcer
when the ulcer occurs in dudenum then it is called dudenal ulcer
it was believed in the earlier times that the lifestylerelated reasons like stress and diet become the reason behind ulcer
after this the researchers have established that hydrochloric acid and pepsin are also responsible for the formation of ulcer
peptic ulcer develops because of helicobacter pailori bacterium
the research has made it clear that most of the ulcers occur because of infection with bacteris helicobacter pailori
helicobacter pailori bacteria produces such mateials which weakens the mucous giving protection to the abdomen
because of the weakening of mucous acid and pepsin there is fatal effect on the abdomen and the formation of acid and pepsin begins even more quickly
the studies have told that the possibility of ulcer increases by smoking
there is also negative impact on the treatment of ulcer by smoking and the possibility of increase in ulcer increases
caffeine increases the process of acid formation which increases the pain in the already formed ulcer
however the increase in the secretion of acid in the abdomen is not just because of the caffeine
till now no direct relationship between peptic ulcer and the consumption of wine has become present
but the established ulcer is found in large quantity in those persons who have sirosis of liver and which is related to greater consumption of wine
although emotional stress is now not considered the main reason behind ulcer yet the people suffering from ulcer complains that the pain of ulcer increases by emotional stress
physical stress could increase the danger of development of ulcer especially in the abdomen
in order to stop the ulcer from developing and stopping its complications there is need for extensive treatment
it is believed that the deficiency in the capacity to protect oneself from strong digestive materials of the abdomen lrb like hydrochloric aci and pepsin rrb is big reason of the formation of ulcer
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory lrb nsaids rrb drugs lrb like aspirin ibruffen and naeproksen rrb increases the dangerous effeect of acid and pepsin in the abdomen
these medicines are commonly present in the headache small pain killers
following are the common symptoms of the occurrence of ulcer however this symptom is different in different people
ulcer does not always manifest some symptoms but the common symptom of ulcer is the burning pain or glowing in between the chest bone and the naval
this pain of ulcer is generally felt in between the two meals and in the morning time
the duration of this pain of ulcer could be from few minutes to few hours
the symptoms of abdominal and dudenal ulcer could be similar to other digestive conditions or general medical problems
please consult your doctor for the proper treatment of ulcer
serious complications could arise because of not taking proper treatment at proper time by the people suffering from ulcer
since ulcer erodes the muscles of abdominal and dudenum walls which could lead to damage in the blood capillaries
the reason behind damage to the blood capillaries could be blood secretion
sometimes ulcer creates hole by eating up the abdominal or dudenal wall due to which bacteria and halfdigested food jumps to the abdominal cavity lrb paritonium rrb which increases the infection in abdominal cavity and the wall
the ulcer situated at the other end of the abdomen lrb where dudenum is attached rrb causes swelling and wound due to which the entrance of the intestine is closed
because of this reason lrb by blockage rrb the food could not come out of the abdomen and could not enter into the small intestine due to which there is vomiting of materials present in the abdomen
how can one detect the ulcer
since different kinds of methods are used for the treatment of different kinds of ulcers therefore the correct treatment of ulcer or pylori is necessary before the treatment
for example the treatment of ulcer produced by nsaid is very different from the ulcer produced by pylori
there are many options for the correct treatment of the ulcer
similarly necessary options are available for the treatment of pylori
included among these processes of treatment is upper gi lrb gastrointestinal series rrb
in gastrointestinal series liquid material like chalk which is borium is given to the patient
after this with the help of the xray of oesophaus abdomen and dudenum the correct situation of the ulcer is examined
in endoscopy flexible instrument at the other end of which camera is fixed is inserted into the oesophagus abdomen and udenum through the mouth so that the upper pipe could be seen completely
the testing of blood respiration and abdominal tissues is carried out to find out the presence of pylori
in earlier times doctors used to give the patients the suggestion to keep away from fried acidic spiy and food having fat
however for the right treatment of ulcer bland food has no longer remained effective
those people who find it that some foods create restlessness in them they should consult their doctor
smoking is related to ulcer not being cured and its being born again therefore ulcer infected people should not smoke
doctors treat the ulcer of abdomen and dudenum with the following medicines
blocker reduces the quantity of acid in the abdomen by stopping the repoduction of histamin which is responsible for secreting acid in the abdomen
there is complete seizure of production of acid in the abdomen by the medicines for stopping the pump of acid
by this acid pump lrb the main place of acid secretion rrb is stoped
antacid mucozal protective agent is used to protect the mucous lining of the abdomen from the harm caused by the acid
antacid mucozal protective agent does not reduce the secretion of acid
during the treatment of pylori these medicines are used with other antibiotics
the discovery of relation between ulcer and pylori has given birth to new alternative antibiotics treatment
in most of the cases the anti ulcermedicines cures the ulcer quickly and effectively
by these medicines with the end of pylori the possibility of ulcer coming up again reduces
however those patients on whom the medicines are not effective or who slowly develop complexities they may need operation
in today times laproscopic surgery is being brought into use for the treatment of ulcer
in vagotiomy process vagus lrb nerve which functions to send the message from the mind to the abdominal nerve rrb is being cut so that the signal could be stopped and the secretion of acid could not take place in the abdomen
in entrectomy the lower portion of the stomach is removed because it produces hormone which is responsible for the secretion of digestive juice in the stomach
pyloriplasty is that operation which could also be done with vagotomy
in the pyloriplasty operation dudenum and small intestine lrb pylorus rrb are made bigger such that the activity of the edible materials could increase from the abdomen
in the future the standard methods of laproscopic operation may become prevalent
laproscope is an instrument of long tube with camera which the surgeopn enters into the skin after putting small cuts and looks at the internal activity on video monitor
gastro oesophygal reflux disease lrb gerd rrb or reflux oesophegaitis is such disease in which the lower portion of the abdomen structure enters into the oesophagus due to which the lining of its soft part is destroyed by the acid
as result of this there is burning sensation in the upper portion of the abdomen which is called epigastric and lower middle chest
heart burn burning sensation or restlessness in the chest bone or behind the sterman are the most common symptoms of acidity
along with this return of gastric material in the mouth or chest lrb regurgitation rrb may happen
oesophagus is big pipe which takes the food from the empty place in the mouth to the stomach in the abdomen
oesophagus crosses the chest and passes through diaphragm
whenever the food comes in the upper protion of the oesophagus this pipe starts kind of activity which is called peristalsis in which the food is brought from oesophagus to the abdomen below
it takes less than one minute to bring the food or liquid material into the door of the mouth
here the acid secreted from the abdomen begins the digestive work on this food
at the lower end of this pipe there is gate protected by thumb like muscles which keeps the lower part sealed so that the food material does not come back to oesophagus after reaching in the abdomen
among the main reasons of gerd unstable lower oesophigial sphincter relaxation reduced led resting tone ineffective oesophigial clearance in the emptying of abdomen and deficiency in the production saliva are included
the most common symptom of gerd is heart burn
the most posibility of occurrence of gerd is after the lunch in the day
some people feel the reflux during the sleep also
the relation of nocturnal reflux lrb while sleeping at the night rrb is generally with more dangerous and excessive oesophigitis
in this the acid remains in the oesophagus for longer time
because there is deficiency in the quantity of production and swallowing of saliva for deactivating the acid
the determination of the symptoms of the loss of oesophigial mucozal and its quantity mainly depends on the quantity of refluxed material and time of the contact of acid in the oesophigial
in the patients suffering from the acidity their internal mucozal resistance system is affected by the excessive reflux which produces many other symptoms also
there are many options for the treatment of the gerd in which change in normal lifestyle to treatment are included
the motive of the treatment of the gerd is to reduce or end its symptoms
to reduce its repetition and the time period of the disease
to fill up the damage of the damaged cells of the oesophagus
the motives of the treatment of gerd are to avoid the spicy fatty and fried food
exercising regularly and reducing the excessive weight of the body could be good beginning towards the prevention of gerd disease
try to take the meal two hours before sleeping
keeping the head of one bed slightly high could also be beneficial in the gerd disease
most of the food materials which have carbohydrate could be the reason for gas
the food materials opposite to this which have fat or protein produces less fat
raphinage lacose fructos and sarbitol are small carbohydrate
this complex quantity of carbohydrate is found more in raphinage beans
however comparatively it is in less quantity in cauliflower sprouts broccolli other vegetables and whole cereals
the natural sharcara present in the milk is called lactose
lactose is also found in sufficient quantity in milk products like cheese ice cream processed food like bread cereals and salad dressing
fructose is naturally found in onion pineapple and wheat etc
fructose is used to produce sweetness in drinks and fruit juice
sorbitol is that sarcara which is naturally found in the fruits lrb in which apple pineapple peach and prune are included rrb
it is used to bring artificial sweetness in dietic food materials and sarcaraless toffees and chewing gums
most of the starch in which potato cereal noodles and wheat etc are included they produce gas because their disintegration and digestion takes place in the large intestine
rice is the only starch which is not responsible for producing gas
generally all vegetables and fruits are considered good source of fiber
any food material which is with peel has fibers
whole cereals pulses with covering also have fibers
in many food materials there are soluble and insoluble fiber
soluble fiber dissolves in the water easily and forms soft jail like shape in the intestines
soluble fiber is found in the barley floor in the peas in the beans and in most of the fruits
the disintegration and digestion of soluble fiber does not take place until it does not reach large intestine where the digestion leads to the production of gas
on the other hand insoluble fiber passes through the intestines without any change and produces less gas
insoluble fiber produces less gas
insoluble fiber is found in wheat bran and some vegetables
those food mateials which could produce gas in some people they may not have any effect on the others
some common bacteria present in the large intestine may destroy the hydrogen produced by the other bacteria
the balance of these two bacteria explains the fact that why gas is formed in some people in larger quantity than in the others
gas is produced in almost every person which is issued out either by belching or through stool
although many people think that they have greater gas problem while in reality its quantity is normal
most of the people produce to pint gas everyday and pass the gas around times everyday
gas is primarily formed by the mixture of odourised vapor carbon dioxide oxygen nitrogen hydrogen and sometimes methane
the unpleasant odourof flatulence comes by that bacteria which is situated in the large intestine and which produces such gas which has sulphur
although the production of gas is common but sometimes it produces restlessness and other conditions
understanding the reasons behind gas paying attention to the methods of its reduction and treatment at the right time could only give riddance from this problem
swallowing the air is common reason behind gas in the abdomen
every person swallows the air in some quantity while eating or drinking
however eating or drinking quickly smoking or wearing the loose artificial teeth etc also become the reason behind aerophisia in some people
burping or hiccup is that process in which nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide lrb which is swallowed along with the air etc rrb exit from the abdomen
the remaining gas goes into the small intestine where its partial absorption takes place
its small quantity also goes into the large intestine where it exits through the way of rectum
when the acid and bicarbonate are mixed in the abdomen then carbon dioxide is also produced from the abdomen but large part of this gas is absorbed in the blood flow and does not enter into the large intestine
those people in whom there is production of methane gas in larger quantity it is not necessary that some special indication be present in them
the stool of that person in whom there is greater production of methane continues to flow in the water
the research has not been able to find why there is greater production of methane in some people when compared to the other people
otis flow disease generally takes place in the children
otis flow disease occurs in the middle of the ear because of the germs
this disease of otis flow could also occur because of syphilis tonsilitis and old cough
the children begin to suffer from the fits of ear pain
when the pus begins to flow out then the pain reduces litle
after cleaning the ear properly with cotton after applying the spray of boric acid blow in the boric iodine and apply the cotton afterwards
clean the ear by putting hydrogen peroxide in the ear
later on put in the cotton after pouring mercurochrome glycerin or aecriolect
after dropping few drops of boric spirit in the ears and cleaning the ears in some time close it with the cotton
in this disease injections of penicillin strepopenicillin comaisin etc are beneficial
sometimes the pieces of gram pea or cotton etc enter into the ear of children or adults which are not able to come out and the patient feels very uncomfortable and laziness
if it is not possible to remove the object in the ear for some time because of swelling etc then warm it by mixing boric acid in the hot water and spray the boric lotion in the ear after the swelling subsides
by this the object fallen in the ear will be removed from its place and could be easily removed with the help of tweezers or matchstick
it should be kept in mind that if insects enter into the ear then for removing that instead of using tweezers or matchstick one should fill it with the hot mustard oil so that the insect or any other thing gets drowned
this way the object fallen in the ear could be easily removed
those people who do not clean their teeth the disease of germs in their teeth is more widespread
holes appear in their teeth or molars
teeth and molars decay and comes out in pieces
the patient suffers extreme pain in the diseases of teeth
in the teeth diseases the pain increases even more by eating sweets
if the tooth or the molar does not move then it is good to fill up silver in them
if the tooth moves then it is better to bring it out
one gets relief by applying carbolic acid or cotton buds with clove oil in the molar hole
teeth are benfitted by taking ostocalcium or similar medicine in which the quantity of calcium is more
in order to protect oneself against the teeth diseases it is beneficial to cleanse the teeth eveyday and use vitamin
there are two kinds of gynaecology lrb leucorrhoea rrb
first leucorrhoea which comes out of the vagina
second leucorrhoea which comes out of cervix
the secretion coming out of the vagina is milky white or yellow and like thin curd during pregnancy
the secretion coming out of the cervix is sticky or with pus
mostly the young girls living in the dirty localities or dense population suffer from leucorrhoea
the inflammation of pregnancy syphillis uterus cancer or tumor on the cervix weakness etc are the main reasons of leucorrhoea
nutritious food fresh air helps in stopping the leucorrhoea
besides this there should be the treatment of other parts of the body which encourages the leucorrhoea disease
before sleeping in the night taking one of the following medicines is also beneficial
common salt dram in ounce
zinc sulpahte dram in ounce tincture iodine in ounce or copper sulphate grains in ounce
eggwhite like secretion begins to come out because of the formation of wound in the cervix of the uterus
in this the wound should be treated
give one tablet of the special medicines lakorina thrice in day and two tablets of leukol thrice in day
use the tablets of micostatin benzene or deluson for ten to fourteen days for keeping inside the vagina
fruit juice is beneficial for the health
fruits are the invaluable gift of the nature for our health
in order to remain healthy drinking the fruit juice has remained our tradition for centuries
recent study has also proved it that by drinking fruit juice not only the day begins well but it also removes the deficiency of the nutritious food
in the reoprt of this research published in medicine journal by the name of archives of paediatrics and adolescent medicine it has been told that those children between to years who take hundred percent fruit juice get more nutritious food than those childen who do not take it
also there is less problems of obesity saturated fat sodium extra sugar and extra fat in the children who drink juice in comparison to those who do not drink juice
society by the name of advisory committee of dietary guidelines for americans have also reached at the same conclusion in its report filed in
the child nutrition researcher dr theresa nicholas in study conducted with her colleagues has considered the above findings to be correct that juice consumers get many main nutrional elements in more quantity
the nutritionist of sita ram bhartiya hospital kajal states that there are many main nutrional elements in the percent fruit juice like vitaminc potassium magnesium follett and iron
because of the presence of lot of taste and nutrition the fruit juice could be called the tasty health drink
the above study also gives reply to the concerns expressed towards the consumption of the fruit juice in the past
in the study this fear is said to be baseless that there is negative impact on the consumption of milk by the consumption of fruit juice
this study has also found the argument of arrival of obesity in children because of percent consumption of fruit juice to be wrong
according to dr nicholas the condition of obesity in children has nothing to do with the hundred percent consumption of fruit juice
this kind of research has proved that there is no danger of obesity in children because of hundred percent consumption of fruits
as opposed to this there is greater danger of obesity in the children who do not drink juice
dr nicholas says we have found that those children who do not take fruit juice they have grater danger of becoming obese
not only this this fact has also come to the light by this research that juice consumers eat more fuit than nonjuice consumers
the interesting thing is that hundred percent fruit juice is in itself considered the image of fruit
therefore it is wise thing to start your day with the tropicana percent fruit juice
in the case of completely using the blessings of the nature and making our future healthy and with complete nutrition the important role of the fruit juice could not be negated

facts related to the heart which is important to be known
maintain your weight as per your age and height
if you want to reduce weight then reduce it by correct means
begin with walking quickly
always workout under the upervision of an experienced trainer
keep in mind that sudden loss of weight could also be the symptom of some unknown disease
anyway by using the other and unhealthy ways of reducing weight your weight may even increase in the future
nutritionist naini sitalwar says instead of ruining your health by harmful options it is better to avoid fried and sweet food
stop eating the products with artificial sweetness
she suggests that if it is necessary then use honey instead of sugar
being slim is the symbol of being healthy
the way in which it is not necessary that the diabetic patient be fat in similar way the condition of heart can not be told by looking at the bodily shape
being slim has its own advantages
but it can not be considered the symbol of being healthy
generally the meaning of being thin is taken as you being healthier than the other people
but this does not mean that you will not have heart diseases
how quickly does your heart beat becomes normal after running for little while or one hour of exercise this could tell correctly about the health of your heart
besides this one could also get to know about the health of the heart by stress test and regular health tests
dr goyal says that one should get regular checkups done after the age of years so that one could keep tab on the health of one heart
accprding to the chief consultant cardiologist dr zakia khan of wockhardt hospital situated in mumbai tests like stress test is able to give less correct results for women in comparison to the men
there is possibility of better results by the technique of imaging with treadmill testing but there is still little problem in case of women because of the breast tissue
there are even more problems in the case of obese women
the edible poducts with cholesterol are always harmful
cholesterol is of both good and bad types
we consider all cholesterol to be our enemy
but doctors tell us that some kinds of cholesterol are good for our health
there is no harm in eating little ghee with roti or dal
our body needs four kinds of cholesterol everyday which plays an important role in keeping us healthy
according to him by cooking the food in olive or mustard oil in one time and sesame or groundnut oil the other time of the day the deficiency of the necessary good cholesterol is satisfied
by keeping away from the the food with excessive oil ghee and sweets you could keep your heart healthy
the relation of the good and bad cholestrol is with the capacity to be the reason behind the diseases of cholestrol
do not consume bad cholestrol which is found in red meat margerine etc
it lead to the increase in ldl and besides heart dieases like artisclerosis it could also cause cancer
the good way of avoiding ldl is cardiovascular workout
like keeping oneself fit with boxing swimming outdoor games etc
do you know that stress and smoking affects women in different way in comparison to the men
dr khan tells that in the women who smoke there is possibility of heart attack occuring years earlier than in the women do not smoke
if compared with the men then the danger of heart disease is more in women who smoke because the level of estrogen hormone which is responsible for keeping them healthy reduces because of this habit
those women who are engaged in the stressrelated jobs they have greater possibility of heart disease in comparison to those women who do not have to take decisions while the truth is opposite for the men
in the female heart patients particularly young female patients layer of cholestrol is not formed in the arteries
throughout the world there are greater deaths of women because of the heart disease and india is not untouched by this
the possibility of occurrence of heart disease in the women are same as the men
after menopause because of the decrease in estrogen level the danger of heart disease increases in the women
the death rate of women at less than years of age because of the heart disease is three times more in comparison to men
on becoming aware of the special symptoms of diseases like breast cancer they could be treated also but lot of women do not take the symptoms of heart dieases seriously
do not take the pain of the neck or the left arm lightly
many times women ignore it by considering it the problem of gastric
the women who smoke eat irregularly have excessive contracepive pills or have job of excessive stress have greater danger of heart disease
therefore get regular checkups
the problem of angina occurs because of the blockage in the artries
the possibility of surviving the first heart attack is half in comparison to that of the men
women have greater possibility of having second attack within year
the treatment of the heart attacks in the women is difficult because their symptoms are not special like men therefore keep on getting regular checkups
it has been told in some studies that even little more quantity than one drink per day could become the reason behind the cancer or heart disease in the women
dr goyal says that one gets nothing by stress nor can you get yourself diseasefree by it
most of the people are disturbed by the tension of daily life
stress for the health increases the problem even more
keeping philosophical approach towards the life could prove to be good for the health
heart disease affects the man and the woman in different ways and the ways of its diagnosis and treatment are also different
the symptoms of heart disease in the women and the men are found to be different
men have special kind of pain in the chest which inceases with toedness while he gets relief by taking rest
as against this women have greater possibility of pain in chest while taking rest or during mental stress
men and women have different levels of cholestrol at different stages of life
its main reason is the level of estrogen in women which causes increase in hdl and reduction in ldl
during pregnancy it has positive impact on the women but after menopause its effect begins to wane along with the decrease in the estrogen level
therefore women are advised to maintain higher hdl cholestrol level in comparison to the men
we have underestimated the indian food
nutritionist naini sheetalwad has handed us over the list of those things which we eat daily and are also beneficial for the health of the heart
tomato and orange have strong antioxidant which is good for the heart
vitaminb is found in large quantity in barley
eat lot of leafy vegetables green leafy vegetables from spinach to coriander mint
vitaminc is mostly found in the fruits
guava has four times more vitaminc than orange
greek olympian athletes used to worship garlic
common cold cough is cured by garlic
garlic has anti fungal and anti bacterial properties
garlic is also very beneficial for the heart
linseed flakeseed has abundant good cholesterol which helps in the prevention of breast cancer
turmeric is also an antibiotic
use it by making its pickle with lemon
pomegranate has three times more antioxidant than red wine and green tea
onion is to be mixed with every vegetable
onion is famous for giving protection to the heart and long life
those grains which appear at that place of child where diaper or nappy is being worn are called diaper or nappy rash
why does diaper rash appear
most important reason if the nappy with excretion of the child remains in contact with the child skin for long time then the grains increase
occurrence of some new soap or detergent in contact with the child delicate skin
diaper rash increase by the diarrhoea in the child
the children wearing disposable diaper instead of cloth nappy suffer more nappy rash
the probability of fungus infection also increases in the rashaffected area
how to save from diaper rash what is the treatment
barrier cream has zinc oxide meaning petroleum which saves the skin of the child from the moisture
your doctor may also tell you to use anti fingus or cream with steroid on seeing the situation of rash
while coming out also make the child wear cloth nappy and put plastic cover over that
immediately change the nappy of the child on its becoming wet
after excretion wash the lower portion of the child with water but do not apply soap on that
let the child remain without nappy for some time
rash will be cured soon on being exposed to the air
keep the skin of the child clean and dry
do not make the child wear another diaper till her skin is completely dry
tie the diaper little loose on the body
after washing the cloth diaper with soap detergent wash it with clean water for times so that the soap comes out completely
it will be better if you iron the cloth nappy of the child after washing it
the moisture present in the nappy will automatically end after being ironed
do not use talcom powder for putting on the nappy
honey is natural pleasant product
honey is prepared as result of collecting in the grooves of the hives after sucking of the flower nectar and adding extra things to it by the bees

taking garlic and honey in the high blood pressure makes the blood pressure normal
one is also benefitted by applying honey on the skin being burnt cut or chipped
drop one drop of honey in one clean glass of water
if the honey settles at the bottom then it is pure and if it dissolves before reaching the bottom then the honey is impure
fly does not get stuck by falling in the pure honey but flies away
on applying pure honey on the eyes there will be little burning but there will be no stickiness
dog leaves the pure honey after smelling but begins to lick the impure one
clothes are not stained by the pure honey

people travel to hours daily for going to work from adjacent areas to main city
in this life of haste number of vehicles running on the roads is bound to grow
from crazy increase in automatic vehicles the rate of road accidents has increased rapidly
as such public does not have any knowledge of small road accidents
it has been seen that individuals hurt in big road accidents die even before reaching the hospital
in deaths occurring in road accidents direct indirect role is of chest wound
hence do not ignore chest wound and treat immediately
the level of emergency health centres is very low in our country
neither is there well founded arrangement for taking person injured in road accident to hospital and nor do the paramedics have the experience of taking injured people safely to the hospital without harming
in about percent injuries of chest facture occurs in ribs
at the same time muscles of chest get damaged
in about percent people lungs get seriously damaged along with occurrence of rib fracture

filling up of air inside chest is called pneumothorax while filling up of blood is called hemothorax
if both these conditions are not treated immediately then in percent cases there is chance of death of patient
therefore on occurrence chest injury one should begin treatment under the surveillance of an experienced thoracic surgeon or danger increases
often in road accidents many ribs break together in many places
in medical terms it is called flail chest or swinging chest
in this flail chest swings separating from original chest
it makes its independent identity

do not tie bandage tightly
patient reach orthopaedicians

one that they waste the precious time received for treatment second right assessment of injured lung does not happen and third to escape from pain occurring in rib injury tight cloth is tied across the chest
sometimes chest is even plastered
by it harm is caused to the patient instead of benefit

when it is unable to come out through given means then it appears in form of some disease or the other
cold disease also falls in the same category
cold has direct relation with stomach
this disease occurs on deterioration of digestion and improper purgation
with the very occurrence of cold vijatiya foreign fluid of body starts flowing from nose in the form of mucous
cold is natural process of expulsion waste material of body therefore on occurrence of cold hunger subsides naturally
taste of tongue goes away
to contribute in this natural process of body one should stop eating as soon as cold occurs
on occurrence of cold you should stop any kind of smoking and drinking alcohol
by their consumption bodily vitamin reduces from which immunity in body lessens
you should not take any medicine without advice of physician
cold is waste expulsion process of body therefore if there is no acute condition then do not take any strong medicine to stop cold
there is also harm from cold stopping altogether
so that there is no infectious effect of cold therefore patient should take as much care of cleanliness as possible
during sneezing patient should sneeze applying towel only
spit defecate etc in such place where you can flush or put mud immediately
if cold does not heal in week then one should take advice from good doctor and should prevent cold specially because there is possibility of pneumonia and bronchitis in such state
firstly you should do natural treatment of cold in the form of first aid
firstly when you feel cold at that time itself keeping feet in hot water take hot bath
before taking hot bath you should definitely drink glass of water
just as you take bath you should cover with blanket etc
perspiration will immediately occur by it
on production of heat by it skin starts its work and the disorder of cold which is near lungs reduces quite lot
if constipated stomach is heavy during cold there can be an ache in the head in such state keep taking lemon water all day
while sleeping at night you should take half spoon of powder of small harad with hot water by which loose motions clear in the morning
fast with removal of waste becomes helpful in constitution of cold and in very less time cold heals with this small treatment itself
you should keep half kilogram spinach filled in vessel pouring one litre water to cook on fire
you should also mix coriander and ginger in little amount
strain its juice after it has cooked well
you should drink from grams to half kilogram of quantity of this juice within hours
if taste does not feel good then mix little salt cumin seeds
stomach will cleanse by this remedy and there will be benefit in cold
occurrence of cold chill is transitional process of body in natural manner
therefore you should not be afraid of it rather you must cooperate in that cleansing process of body through patience and natural therapy
if you see complication of disease increasing then you should consult with an experienced therapist
when you get the ordinary looking disease of cold then it distresses the very best of person
when this very cold gets old then it becomes unbearable and becomes the cause of many diseases
hence begin natural therapy the moment cold begins
karshya disease is called excess slim in common language
in such state body is excessively thin weight is less and bones of body show
physical beauty is not attractive because of thinness
physical weight is less in proportion to height
we call it karshya disease in ayurveda
where some people want to eliminate their obesity there some people want to eliminate their thinness
meaning they want to become fat
actually everyone wants this only that they may neither be excessively fat nor excessively thin
body should be filled out weight should be right
not that one should be so thin that bone structure shows or so fat that tummy protrudes
lessening of weight is also not good and increasing weight much is also not good
weight should remain right in proportion to height of body
the people whose weight is less such people should first of all eliminate digestion related defects
when digestion would be right only then food eaten will be digested properly and from it there will be construction of appropriate seven elements and body will form
hence you should first fix digestion
in my therapy have found the patients that come for the purpose of weight increase and increase in fatness afflicted with digestive disorders like lack of appetite indigestion of food constipation gas etc

it is called rubb anar
the total amount of iron in body is grams
about iron gets accumulated in various tissues in the form of ferritin and hemosiderin
about various enzymes lrb cytochrome oxidase catalase peroxidase rrb are in the form of residue
other than having oxygen the requirement of iron is for the various biochemical processes
the problem of deficiency of iron is found in about half the population of the world
it has become known from surveys that more than half men and two third women in our country are afflicted with anemia because of deficiency of iron
tissues also get damaged from excess of iron even death can occur
the requirement of an adult male is of mg iron daily
iron is in abundance in eggs fish
this iron is called heme iron
its absorption from intestines is till about whereas iron is also in green leafy vegetables grains pulses its absorption from intestines happens with less ease
vitamin acid secreted from urinary bladder increases its absorption whereas tea husk fiber fitate phosphate phenal chemicals reduce its absorption
hence there is more possibilty of occurrence of deficiency of iron in vegetarians
the absorption of iron from intestines depends on the iron accumulated in body
from reduction of amount of iron in body its absorption from intestines increases whereas reduces from increased amount
if absorbed iron in intestines is in free form then its extremely harmful it is insoluble and its use is unable to take place in body
in blood iron stays joined with transferrin protein
iron is utilised in red blood cells in bone marrow for the production of hemoglobin
it reaches the cells through blood and remain joined with ferritin protein in blood this way iron is soluble and less harmful
when required body can use it
if amount of ferritin increases in cells then it turns into insoluble hemosiderin which can be harmful for body
about one gram iron is accumulated mainly in liver cells and macrophage
on the occurrence of requirement of iron accumulated in body body uses it
the deficiency or excess of iron in body can be detected from blood iron level transferrin and ferritin
deficiency of iron is present in half the population in the world
the deficiency of iron in body can be because of its absence in adequate amount in food
the of iron present in vegetarian food happens with less from intestines hence possibilty of deficiency is more
the requirement of iron in childhood youth pregnancy increases
so if iron is not consumed in additional amount then deficiency can occur
from less absorption of iron in old age also the possibility of occurrence of anemia increases
if iron comes out with blood with bleeding from body then also deficiency of iron occurs in body
deficiency of iron occurs from occurrence of hookworm infection intestines that suck blood extreme bleeding during menses in women
deficiency of iron can occur from bleeding from intestines or other body parts also
there is special danger of iron deficiency in the poor category in children that do not drink milk women the aged
in the second quarter of pregnancy more or less all women become victims of iron deficiency
more serious problems occur because of excess of iron
if capsules tablets with more iron or food substances containing iron are consumed for long time or more iron reaches inside body through other causes
tissues become damaged from the effect of the active free radicals being produced from excess of iron
if because of thalassemia sickle cell anemia etc blood needs to be given at regular intervals then iron starts accummulating in body in more amount
in some people absorption of iron from intestines takes place in large amount because of which also there can be excess of iron in body
this disease is usually hereditary because of irregularity in genes
this disease of excess of iron is called hemosiderosis
spots appear on skin on iron reaching body in much amount
diabetes can occur from urinary bladder getting damaged
cirrhosis can occur from liver getting damaged the possibility of liver cancer increases
the seminal vesicles of men may get destroyed
weakness fatigue takes place one can become impotent weight decreases swelling and pain occurs in joints vomit and vertigo occur
the form of kidney may grow hair fall fluid may accumulate in stomach heart diseases may occur
the test of excess of iron can take place from blood iron transferrin measure of ferritin level biopsy of kidney
iron being in excess can be fatal hence to take it out of body injections of desferal are given regularly
on there being continual necessity of giving blood you need to give these injections for days slowly for days
this treatment if difficult and extremely expensive
now medicine that can be eaten in the form of capsule that makes iron from body ineffective has been developed
hopefully it will soon be available in country too
in patients of hereditary hemosiderosis ml blood is taken out every week so that excess of iron does not take place
from this treatment there is no possibility of their death from diseases of heart liver
nowadays it is often heard that such and such person has allergy
the more the use of modern synthetic medicines is increasing the more use of allergy is also increasing
hives sheeta pitta rash and leucoderma named diseases have been mentioned in ayurveda science they come under the allergies of these days only
allergy or hives is reaction of the body which is produced by eating or touching those substances which are not favourable to the constitution of individuals
we call constitution being favourable shastra satmya and unfavourable asatmya
some people get an allergy from wearing clothes made of synthetic thread
in these people symptoms of allergy develop from eating some specific foreign medicines from which speed of breathing increases
pulse becomes weak and even death takes place from occurrence of shock and nervousness
the people who get an attack of hives or allergy they should immediately use medicine
if is unsuccessful in arrangements by oneself then one should not delay in sending to good therapist or hospital without losing time
that ayurvedic medicines also cause less benefit in allergy is not the case
not feeling sleepy or feeling less sleepy is surely disease but feeling too sleepy is also disease it is called hypersomnia

the name of indolence itself is disease
often people bring to fore an indolent life imagining happiness
they pay for the adverse effects of this benediction much later
actually an indolent life looks happy from afar but its not like that
such lifestyle does not give rise to one but many diseases
one quiet murderer of these is diabetes which goes on making the body hollow from inside
in ancient indian lifestyle many kinds of exercises and yogas have hence been included
surya namaskar is such an exercise which makes parts of the whole body active but many people do not do it because they find it like religious form
with regular exercise many physical problems with diabetes can be kept at bay
the young generation is more conscious of health as compared to the last generation
this is the very reason that gyms and fitness centres are seen comparatively more
despite this surveys tell us that now this fatal disease has started hemming in from youth itself
may the cause be stressful lifestyle or an extra attachment towards fast food the number of patients of diabetes is increasing fast
skin happens to be the safety armor of our body its care needs to be taken all year round
every season brings challenges for the skin
dry weather soaks all the moisture of skin
many diseases house themselves as soon as oil safety armor moves away from dry skin
it will be better that you take care of skin regularly so that lustre of skin sustains during extreme winters
children often have complaints of cold cough during winters
if breathing related problems remain for long time then the capacity of children to fight with disease decreases
the cause of tuberculosis in children is also negligence
along with the season changing from rains to winter one has become victim of many skin related problems
in winter season dryness in the atmosphere starts increasing
from this skin starts getting dry
along with this in this season problems like sun allergy winterege insect allergy also appear
one can prevent skin related problems with little cautiousness and maintenance of skin
commonly people like the winter sun lot
so people spend more time in open sunlight which later on takes the form of sun allergy
one likes this sunlight but being very strong it burns the skin
one should use sunscreen on occurrence of sun allergy
according to the environment of the capital one should use sunscreen of spf
as long as possible keep skin covered
one gets to see the problem of psoriasis also in winter season
psoriasis is called aprasa
skin of palm and soles starts coming out
because of it often itching starts
red patches also appear
fungal infection also appears in winter season
we call it shingles in common language
red patches start forming at different places in body
the spots where this problem arises skin there becomes very dry
one should consult with doctor on appearance of such allergy
allergy starts arising in skin from insect bites also
sore like spots start forming in the open part of skin
burning sensation occurs in it swelling also appears later on
one should use anti allergic cream on such places of skin
on occurrence of much problem one should consult with skin specialist
this problem is seen more in changing season
skin starts becoming dry because of allergy
it starts healing on its very own with increase in coldness
to prevent it one should start using winter body lotion as soon as the season changes
those whose skin is very dry they need to take more care
walnut is the best source of protein
there is also much fiber in them and antioxidants like vitamin magnesium and vitamin are also there
as such monosaturates and polyunsaturated fats are there in all kinds of kernels lrb almond cashew pistachio musk melon and water melon rrb
in all of these the place of walnut is totally different
in walnut omega fatty acid is present in the largest amount than other kinds of kernels
it has been found from researches going on for more than decade that on including walnut in regular diet flexibility in blood vessels increases and chance of formation of clot becomes weak
the quality most important than all of these in walnut is that ldl cholesterol lrb responsible for heart disease rrb and reactive protein reduces by it
reactive protein has recently been said marked for heart disease
walnut is not only advantageous for heart diseases but for many other problems also
meaning walnut has specifically important role in arthritis providing relief from pain of joints
walnut can also be used for psoriasis and treatment of skin diseases
walnut can also be used as laxative
the fibers present in it prove to be helpful in providing relief from constipation
it has found from researches that the people who eat walnuts regularly do not have liver problems
tuberculosis this disease happens from mycobacteria
every year about lakh people die of this disease
in this most deaths occur in developing countries
in the world about lakhs new tuberculosis patients are increasing in which are in developing countries
at any time there remain about one and half to two crores of tuberculosis patients in the world in which tuberculosis bacteria remain present in the expectoration of half the patients
in india tuberculosis bacteria are present in about of the population and every year lakh deaths occur from tuberculosis
every minute somewhere or the other someone is dying of tuberculosis
one patient of tuberculosis in whose expectoration tuberculosis bacteria are present is spreading the disease every year in to new people
when tuberculosis disease is present in the country with such horridness then even children can not escape it
when tuberculosis patient coughs or sneezes then tuberculosis bacteria come out in thousands
their large drops do drop on the ground but minute drops keep floating in the air
tuberculosis patients are mostly poor uneducated where the whole family lives in small closed room
the number of bacteria in the room increases from coughing continuously which reach the bodies lungs and other body parts of other family members through breath
children who stay weak immediately come in their grip
it produces reaction on reaching the lungs of children
finishing one cycle in weeks bacteria reaches the stage of dormant
during this children may have common fever cough cold coryza etc which heals even without treatment but some children who are malnourished are afflicted with some other serious disease or whose disease resistance capacity is weak such child needs treatment urgently
other than lungs tuberculosis can influence any part of body
its diagnosis in children is very difficult
only clever specialist therapists can diagnose it on time
on getting health test of child you can get diagnosis from conducting some blood tests and ray sonography
one another tuberculin test is also conducted whose report is received after to hours
tuberculin test being positive shows that bacteria of tuberculosis have entered the child
in emaciated and sick weak children this test may be negative even in presence of tuberculosis
this test may be negative in those children also whose disease resistance capacity is weak
once diagnosis has been done one can get free of this disease on taking medicine regularly for six months under the care of therapist
child can get seriously ill on not getting diagnosis or treatment on time or child can lose life
therefore always be aware and on occurrence of doubt get advice of wise specialist doctor
if these symptoms exist in children then there may be tuberculosis
weight of child not increasing or remaining stable or reducing little
feeling weak
recurrence of fever in child
eyes getting red with fever
occurrence of coughing lrb breath rrb and weight not increasing
occurrence of sudden pain in chest and fever

such child who is not fully healthy even on healing of measles whooping cough or disease of tonsils in throat
child has no problem in urination even then coming of pus or blood in urine
on occurrence of any of the above symptoms consult with specialist doctor
bad breath because of diabetes shaking of molars or teeth growth of gaps between the teeth etc kind of disorders occur
in the above situation one should increase the dose of medicines and get tested from good doctor
during treatment we met many such patients who had no knowledge of diabetes
on seeing condition of gums and from other symptoms one detects the possibility of disease of diabetes which can be determined in pathology from testing the blood
dentists talk about extracting teeth merely on occurrence of decrease in sugar amount in patient
there is wrong conception in some dentists that until blood sugar reduces wound will not heal from extraction of tooth
since this conception is produced because of misunderstandings hence from the point of view of the masses it is not an easy task to extract it
believe that as and when you shaking or decaying tooth keep coming out your graph of blood sugar will slowly start coming down
keep in mind that blood flow in body is maximum in the upper part of body meaning in head and mouth
when there would be more blood flow there would also heal soon
from too much flow of blood in the mouth wound of diabetes patients with more blood heals like that of normal person and sugar also reduces from extracting all shaking teeth
keep in mind that blood sugar increases in situation of pus anywhere in body
pus situated in gums reduces along with extraction of teeth accordingly blood sugar also reduces
test teeth of children every months and make child brush from the age of one year
teeth of children will go bad soon from giving child too much chocolate biscuit
after meal brush your teeth on gargling and after brushing at night surely floss
surely learn the appropriate method of brushing teeth
get your teeth cleaned by dentist every year
there is good and cheap treatment of decayed teeth in the initial stage
eating carrot radish apple fruit etc remains beneficial for gums
use extremely soft brush like super soft toothbrush and massaging gums is very good exercise for teeth and gums
do not use toothpick paper pin
colourful dentifrice brings harm to teeth and gums
after extracting tooth surely place another teeth in the empty space
our hair increases naturally about to cm in one month
there is direct effect of food habits on the rate of growth of length of hair
also there is hereditary pattern in the rate of increase in length of hair
often patients come with problem that their hair grows very slowly in length or do not grow more after growing till definite length
such problem can be distributed in the following types
the rate of growth of length in hair remains very slow
hair does not increase more after increasing till definite length
with merely little increase in length hair becomes brown and split at the ends
the biggest cause of problem of this kind is deficiency of nutritious substances and lack of proper care
for the circle of hair to go on smoothly it is extremely necessary for the body to get iron calcium etc nutritious substances in the right amount
this problem also arises because of not applying right oil in hair
not using the right shampoo is also its cause
from use of harmful chemical comprising oil shampoo etc hair ends become split and brown
use of dryer on hair roots also stops hair growth and makes them rough and lifeless
if hair is not trimmed for long time then also growth of hair gets affected
because hair ends break on becoming lifeless and hair starts tangling in itself
hereditary reason or family pattern is also responsible for hair growth
because the composition of hair depends on the composition of hair of parents
if deficiencies of nutritious substances are visible in patient then medicine for the purpose of fulfilment of nutritious substances should be given
also it is important to mind food habits
meal should comprise all nutritious substances
definitely consume milk
use the right ayurvedic oil in hair twice or thrice week
shampoo should be ayurvedic
do not use any product consisting of harmful chemicals in hair
do not use dryer on hair roots
once month definitely use henna consisting of herbal mixture in hair
save your hair from strong sun and strong wind
in weeks definitely get trimming of your hair done
environmental pollution also stopping its growth makes hair rough and lifeless
hence one should save hair from environmental pollution also
because rough and lifeless hair grow very less in length
do not use any kind of soap for washing hair
there is high detergent in soap that causes damage to hair
some soaps in market come especially for hair one should not use them either
after washing hair one should not dry it jerking at it
harm is caused to hair from it and growth in length also decreases
many people whose hair is curly have complaint that their hair grow very less in length
often in this situation length of hair surely remains normal but hair turns round with growing in length hence growth in hair is visible less

as much as possible eat fresh fruits and vegetables
be careful in slippery places and prevent getting injured
go to health club or gym

on advice of the doctor you can use machines like treadmill or exercise box
nowadays people are spending half their lives in office
bad times have made office duty so difficult that job has started affecting health of people
if your weight is increasing because of office then it important to keep in mind some things
you want to bathe get ready and reach office on time but forget to have breakfast in this haste
if you do not have breakfast then the routine of your meals gets upset and you overeat in lunch
to ask truthfully it is very big reason of weight increase
include those things in breakfast in morning which you can make easily or which may be easily available
you can take things like brown bread sandwich with cornflakes or milk
if there is canteen in your office then you can eat something over there too but it should be healthy food and not fast food
no matter how busy you are definitely take lunch break of half an hour
you can take this lunch break between to
it would be better than you have lunch with your colleagues
this way you will be able to have lunch on time
take lunch break of to minutes
this way you have relaxed lunch and when you will be full you will not overeat during dinner
this way the order of your meals will remain set
if you have less time for lunch then you eat in hurry but prevent this
do not play with your health because of five ten minutes
if eating out is compulsion then instead of eating in restaurant you can have tiffin service
if you reach from home to office and then directly from office to home then it is obvious that you must be unable to do any physical exercise

it will be better if you look for excuses for physical exercise
you can go to buy things like vegetables milk bread for home
you can go to drop children to the bus for school

some calorie will surely burn from strolling
you start feeling sleepy after lunch and you have coffee to get rid of it
first thing is that you prevent taking coffee but if it compulsion then take less amount of coffee
actually caffeine present in coffee surely removes your lethargy but your weight may increase from the sugar present in it
whenever you feel lethargic drink water

it is important for mothers that they breastfeed the infants
temperature remains in control with this
there happens to be temperature control center in the brain which keeps temperature of body maintained at degrees

on occurrence of hypothermia to adults obstacle is produced in blood circulation respiration and neuro system
on occurrence of hypothermia these systems may stop working

mother should keep new born stuck to her chest for an hour each three to four times day
to protect an infant from cold one should wrap cotton on his chest and keep
one may wear clothes in many folds on body
by wearing clothes in many folds the air that is between the folds keeps the air outside outside and the air inside inside

if you are thinking of going to the parlor then be careful
nowadays because of the increasing interest towards beauty women of all ages have started arriving at the beauty parlor

skin with allergy heals only after long treatment of many months
infection also spreads from brush combs roller pin etc used in parlors because in parlors women of many kinds and categories come
if certain woman had dandruff in her hair then on bringing is use the same comb or brush by others dandruff in hair may occur
in beauty parlors possibility of skin related allergy is more also possibility of eczema and contact dermatitis increases more

later water starts secreting from it too
warts appear in viral infection from which tiny hard vesicles occur on skin
from this tiny rashes like water form on skin
because of not sterilising blade shaver or razor and from using the same on every customer fatal diseases like aids may occur
because blood comes out from cutting and tearing of skin from using these tools and if this happens with an hiv afflicted customer then his blood can easily spread hiv in other customers
mostly working women leave on getting facial and bleaching etc done in hurry
on not doing facial properly in hurry skin pores remain open permanently and pimples occur in them
in bacterial infection red rashes injuries with pus red blotches swelling and fever lumps vesicles etc can also occur
in infection lice may occur on skin of body other than scalp
in protozoal infection on being afflicted with scabies itchy and watery rashes start erupting in hands feet

going to the parlors is not harmful if caution is maintained such parlor should be selected which is clean and lighted
while working in the parlor from use of gloves by the beautician danger of spreading of infection is absent
women with children or sensitive skin should use an antiseptic lotion after getting hair cut or should wash hair with medicated shampoo so that any kind of allergy of infection is unable to occur
woman suffering from allergy cold and contagious disease should get beauty treatment done at home itself
as much as possible one should take one own comb brush pin nail cutter towel napkin and gown
it is better if you also use your own beauty products eye liner lipstick face powder
during bridal make up take your own beauty ingredients with you

the most important thing for leading the most successful and complete life is energy
there is infinite quantity of energy in every person the necessity is to use it properly
it is also said that if you have talent and energy then you are king if you have energy but not talent then you are prince but if you have talent but not energy then you will remain beggar
because of today modern life style our natural energy is used less
therefore by adopting some rules we can maintain our natural energy by which we can take full enjoyment of healthy life
we can maintain our energy by nutritious and balanced diet
healthy diet is percent water based in which fruits and vegetables are included
include salad in the meal and by reducing caffeine meat dairy sugar and snacks take nutritious food
regular exercise is also brilliant source of increasing energy level
for better health and energy it is very necessary to be aerobically trained because it supplies oxygen to the body
your lungs heart digestion etc will work better only when you are fit
research tells that if you have done months of regular exercise then it will be useful for your whole life
even then do find at least three days in week for exercise
the lower portion of our lungs is larger than upper portion and correct amount of oxygen is needed for breathing
generally taking less deep breaths is common as result of which several problems also begin to come up in which reduction in energy level is also included
therefore take power breathing at least thrice day
for this inhale deeply by counting one hold the breath by counting till four and by counting two exhale
for example if you inhale deeply for four seconds the hold for seconds and exhale in seconds
repeat this process for ten times
in order to renew your energy adopt balanced life style
when we do lot of and difficult work then in it energy is reduced in large quantity and we gain nothing
therefore in order to become successful person finish the work by dividing them properly work after resting little
balanced life is not formed naturally but it is formed by oneself by keeping in mind one daily routine and work habit
emotions are also helpful in reducing our energy level to large extent
those who live in negative emotions stress depression or any kind of fear they have difficulty in being inspired and encouraged towards life
on the other hand those people who are full of happiness and enthusiasm and who are optimistic have great energy level
so adopt positive attitude in life and become optimistic by throwing out tension fear

that treatment had made her belief strong that hardeep could also get well and he will even be able to walk like normal children one day
according to manpreet as result of the stem cells implanted in my son his fits are slowly becoming less frequent
his is improving and he has started to speak some words like mummy papa
this three year old child from dehradun has now begun to walk with support after the stem cells were implanted first time in january
he has begun to climb up the stairs and the biggest thing is that he has even begun to move forward on the ground without support
there is also improvement in the shape of his eyes and face
praising the treatment satnam says that earlier the left hand of my son was very weak but he has now begun to use that
his eye contact is also improving
for us treatment is nothing short of god blessing
dr gita sarraf who is treating hardeep in the newtek mediworld at new delhi by methodology has to say that is creating good effect on hardeep and am very happy looking at his development
actually the research and discovery of the director of newtek mediworld and stem cell specialist dr gita sarraf has played an important role in the treatment of many incurable diseases like parkinson spine injury cases related to the accident in which the patient has gone in coma nervous system disease dystrophy of muscles etc
she treats the patients with the cell line of the stem cell of the embryo donated voluntarily by couple meaning embryo is not needed again and again
according to dr sarraf developing the cell line of human embryonic stem cell is in itself big discovery of the medical science in the whole world
the biggest thing in it is that they have not mixed any kind of animal product in it it is completely human product dr gita is excited on seeing its effect after using this therapy on patients
you become breathless on climbing stairs you become out of breath after running for two hundred meters you become tired after walking to the nearby market
do you have this problem
what have you done about it
you took little rest and then forgot it but not this that this symptom is pointing towards the deficiency of iron
first of all you learn how did you contract the deficiency of iron
the diet that you are taking is that not the balanced diet
do you like to eat junk food more
or you remain so busy in working that you forget that after working so hard you must take only balanced diet
instead of this you just manage by eating anything
whatever be the reason the reality is that not taking proper and balanced diet could become the main reason of deficiency of iron
the person becomes anaemic by blood loss he becomes deficient of blood
the bleeding occurring in the body which is generally not visible could also cause deficiency of blood
it could also happen because of piles ulcer or blood loss from nose
the deficiency of blood means deficiency of iron
if energy level is falling tiredness is causing problems face has become pale then do not consider others responsible for this
your hemoglobin is gm per millilitre blood
for women this quantity is gm per millilitre
its being less means you are anaemic
children could become anaemic because of the germs in the intestines
their physical and mental development is affected by this but taking iron more than required is also not good for health
it causes mokromatosiz which adversely affects the liver
there are also genetic reasons behind the deficiency of iron
if there is the complaint of indigestion in your family sufficient nutrients could not get digested in the intestines then also you could be anaemic
if the mother is anaemic during pregnancy then she could give birth to anaemic child
many problems arise because of being anaemic
the feeling of tiredness throughout the day is problem
anaemic means the deficiency of hemoglobin in the body because of which the body gets less oxygen
women of every age should give special attention to their diet so that appropriate amount of iron intake could be ensured
the blood loss which takes during the menstruation that could be compensated by the balanced diet
those women who lose more blood during the menstruation they should take iron supplements
according to the world health organisation during pregnancy and breast feeding women should take more iron rich diet
its quantity should be milligram per day
taking iron supplements is good but do take without the prescription of doctor
start iron only on being suggested by doctor
there could be many reasons behind anemia first it is necessary to diagnose them
never take iron supplements in empty stomach
they should be taken at fixed time in the day
generally it is beneficial to take that food which has more iron
there is more iron in papaya mango pomegranate and banana among fruits while there is more iron in brown rice sunflower seeds chickpeas wheat germ carrot beetroot lotus stem mustard leaves and green leaves like spinach and cauliflower among cereals and vegetables
if you are non vegetarian then take argon meat red meat pea food moiser dry fish for iron
include brown rice barley lentils moong green pea apple and grapes in your diet but avoid urad and sesame seed oil because they take time in digestion
it is to be noted that the digestive system of anaemic persons are weak therefore they should eat in less quantity
in many food stores one gets organic extracts which is nutritious
if you do not like green vegetables then take their powder extracts
you will get the powder of cabbage beetroot spinach and oat
mix two spoonfuls of powder in water or milk and drink that
besides these liquid extracts of herbs like dandelion and horsetale are also available which helps in fighting with anemia
these herbs produce iron in the body and they also do not cause constipation
it should be especially mentioned that calcium and iron tablets should not be taken together
because they interfere in each other digestion
the complaint of increasing weight is common because of the modern food habits
burger french fries along with being costly also increases the obesity
working till late night stress of the big project the hanging sword of deadline unusual eating time and ways put bad effects on the body
one should avoid saturated fats like beef lamb pork butter cream milk cheese coconut oil
instead of this one could control high blood pressure by taking poly unsaturated fats
take stock of your body on the weekly basis
especially keep an eye on your waist
do not hesitate in any way to check the increasing inches
in this taking lemon water regularly is also beneficial

vikas jain of agra is one of those fortunate patients to whom despite breaking of bone at the age of neither did the fear of death bother nor did he have to spend too much in doing daily chores
as matter of fact all this is the wonder of new hip surgery which treats patients quite soon
according to senior orthopaedician dr murthy of fortis hospital situated in new delhi now through such new techniques and equipment changing hip has become possible
according to dr murthy capacity of hip to bear weight is more than all other joints of body on account of being surrounded with cartilage ligaments and muscles
he has to say that cartilage is extremely flexible because of which no pain occurs in walking around
dr murthy says that until hip gets damaged the flexible cartilage of extreme ends of bones remains covered
according to him on the contrary after getting damaged cushion of cartilage gets removed because of which bone gradually gets rough and holes appear in places
he says that on walking around and roaming about in this condition ball in the socket starts snagging hence one feels cramp and pain whereas in healthy condition of the hip ball rotates easily
because of this snagging does not occur and one does not feel stiffness and pain
now one can do hip transplant easily
they say that these operations can be conducted successfully in india which are also cheaper as compared to foreign countries
according to dr murthy this surgery is selected for providing relief from any kind of damage or swelling in hip
proxima hip lrb mini hip rrb is such modern discovery which is an ideal combination between unnatural unsemantid hip replacement lrb transposition rrb
according to dr murthy at least six inches of metal is included in unsemantid hip joint on the upper layer of bone of thigh which is called femur
dr murthy says that with time and with age these joints mostly start snagging
according to him one has to change them again after to years
dr murty says that there is fear of the ball getting limp on the surface of hip transplant and also there can be fracture from neck to femur bone
according to him through mini or proxima hip surgery both these problems can be treated very well with an infinitesimal hostility and along with this itself correction done in young patients also remains ordinary and clear
according to him there is ease for patients to get surgery for second time in life

spine related disease scoliosis that produces trouble of heart and lung has been the subject of speculation for ages
at our place until now people have considered it untreatable whereas in modern medical science its treatment has become quite easy and satisfactory
from the negligence of which either there can be hump back or another kind of distortion may occur in the spine
along with hump permanent freedom from other disorders of spine is possible
according to dr sharma the organization of spine is such that bending of it forwards backwards left right is possible
his statement is that there is disc in the center of vertebra and behind this disc from the center of spine spinal canal passes the nerves within which go from the brain towards hands and feet
his statement is that this disc happens to be soft and flexible like rubber through which this spine provides flexibility to the spine
according to dr sharma the cause of abnormal growth in spine has not been detected yet whereas in other causes there are congenital deficiencies like absence of one two bones or presence in half or being joint together
according to him due to unknown reasons number of patients of spine disorder is up to to it is called idiopathic scoliosis and to percent patients get this disease because of congenital causes which is called congenital scoliosis
according to him many patients get hump related spine disorders that occur from weakness arising in muscles due to paralysis which is called paralytic scoliosis
according to dr manoj sharma treatment of hump is normally done to end ugliness because these diseases are found more in girls
according to dr sharma from extreme distortion there can be an effect on lungs and heart hence its treatment is important
dr sharma says that some distortion can treat itself with age and for it only appropriate exercise or braces lrb jacket rrb is proper but if hump is too much then it goes on increasing with time and patient may land in quite distorted state
also he can become helpless physically
according to dr sharma treatment of people is possible only through surgery
according to him these days treatment of hump lrb distortion of back rrb is done according to scientific technique lrb derotation of apical vertebra rrb if distortion has become excessive or quite old then it is straightened after making it flexible through endoscopic technique
according to dr sharma inserting endoscope in chest or stomach many discs are taken out from distorted spine after this spine becomes straight easily
earlier this task used to happen through major surgery opening up chest or stomach in which lot of blood used to flow and recovery of patient was possible after many days and often death of patient used to take place
other than this because of occurrence of extreme strain on the spinal cord while straightening out the back there is danger of occurrence of paralysis in feet to prevent such situation nerves are also monitored side by side during operation
according to dr manoj sharma it is detected late in girls hence diagnosis of disorder in backbone as soon as possible is important
he says that if it is not treated while there is time then this disorder takes form and patient becomes ugly disease becomes chronic on growing too much
the permanent treatment of getting rid of any stomach disease is hydrotherapy because it is the modern simple scientific european technology treatment of the old fashioned without medicine infallible treatment lrb complete basti panchkarm rrb
in this the patients can themselves see the real root cause toxins lrb old dried lumps of stool dryness many layers of muck gas acid mucous rot etc rrb of diseases constipation gas acidity ulcer piles etc of your very own stomach coming out
on uniting with ozone therapy its benefits increase more
after this you will get saved from expense of churna medicines forever
the whole world has authenticated it because there are only benefits from it no chance of harm or side effects
colon lrb descending colon rrb is like sewer line for the whole body from its cleansing removal of disease of the whole body along with the stomach diseases is certain
when chuckles of baby echo in the house then the whole family is filled with happiness but just imagine that you child like playing developing physically like ordinary children but suddenly being years old has started to look like year old
perhaps this situation is little strange to you
there are such innumerable diseases that we are unaware of progeria is one of them
progeria is such disease child afflicted with which grows like ordinary children but till the age of seven years
after that such turn comes in his life which changes his whole life
it seems like someone has pressed the fast forward button of his life and he finds himself in the period of senility
it is the only such family in india where more than one child is in the grips of this disease
parents of ali and ikramul are bisul khan and mother razia
they are total seven brothers and sisters from which children are victims of progeria
one out of which had an untimely death the other got killed because of pneumonia
that is to say that it is such disease the prevention of which can not be made from prior assumption
child who is of years of age whose weight should be kg height should be cm his weight is kg and height is cm
no doubt that were made like ordinary children by feeding but the age gap that they have completed in merely few years will never end
you will be amazed to know that if the fan is turned on full speed then they are unable to support themselves when they are not helped
they are mentally absolute children but have had aged in body
there are many types of progeria
out of which hutchinson gilford progeria syndrome lrb rrb is also one
the symptoms of this disease are decrease in body fat formation of wrinkles in skin reduction of hair
all those things which are in an old man
dr ajay mukherjee has made the statement that it is possible that there is no method of prevention of this situation but it has been seen in the past few years that if some changes are made in their lifestyle and food habits then life can be bit better
despite this the reality is that the normal life that others are leading they happen to be miles away from them
they are physically weak
therefore they become sensitive from even little sports
they have to go through every such situation through which elderly have to go through
meaning osteoporosis arthritis skin related diseases rather they need the help of others for every small task
they even need help to change clothes
this has also been detected from recent study that the children afflicted with progeria that die of atherosclerosis lrb heart related disease rrb their average age is years
however it has been seen traditionally that age of patients is on an average around years
as of now these children know everything understand and they even know that their age is not very long and yet they try to lead their life in way different from others
water therapy has dominant position in the therapy order of naturopathy
according to the point of view of louis kuhne often the main cause of diseases in most people is the accumulation of stool in descending colon
currently the only naturopathic simple cure for cleansing or washing descending colon is enema
pain reduces at that very time or in little time
without enema one can not imagine the therapy course of naturopathy
detoxification of descending colon through enema and diet change these two are the main foundation pillars of natural therapy
naturopath can start therapeutic work only through the means of enema pot
if there is only enema pot in the hands of therapists that travel in villages even then he can treat successfully in various situations
normally without catheter use of enema can as such happen
for children elderly and weak patients there is convenience in getting up water through catheter
otherwise there is possibility of nozzle coming out by the speed of water gas or stool
while giving enema one should take care of condition of patient
if he is weak or of less life force then you should give him enema of water
you can give cold water or water of less than degrees temperature only to strong man
enema pot should normally be kept at height of to feet
in special situation when the intestines of patient are weak there is swelling injury ulcer or wound in intestines then one should keep enema pot at maximum height of one foot and minimum half foot
by this water will reach intestines at very low speed otherwise stomach starts aching with the speed of water
there is fear of shock reaching the soft walls inside the colon
before inserting nozzle of enema inside the anus some water should be first taken out of it
the air filled inside the tube should come out
you should apply oil on nozzle or catheter while giving enema
so that it is able to enter anus easily
so that no friction occurs in the inner skin
by breathing deeply entrance of water inside is facilitated
water is pulled inside the intestines by deep breathing
after enema water has gone inside by doing an action like bhastika lrb moving stomach up and down rrb water that has reached inside the intestines exits taking out stool
if there is inconvenience in stopping enema water then before taking enema itself give hot cold compress to stomach for minutes
by doing ordinary hot compress also there is help in expulsion of stool
enema water starts going inside with speed or water stays cold then sometimes there is stomachache
at that time one should immediately stop water from entering inside
one should allow water to enter slowly on stopping of pain
to stop water you can press enema tube with finger
if there is clip then it can be used
if on doing this also there is pain in passage of water then water should be made to reach the intestines with less speed reducing the enema pot height
pain reduces by this also
process of giving enema
by making him lie still on his back this method is comfortable for patient
one should give enema to extremely weak patients only after making him lie still
this condition is appropriate for diseases like typhoid cholera
by this there is no chance of any kind of shock reaching the intestines of patient which are already weak
my making him lie down on right side
this state is considered right for patients of moderate health
while making the patient lie down one should keep in mind that right leg is straight and left one is slightly bent
however right leg should also be kept loose not keeping it taut
by this no pressure may be there on anus
by doing this one can insert nozzle inside easily
there is also ease in water going inside
making him lie down on left side
enema is not given in this condition often
when one needs to take water in less quantity and needs to clean only rectum and descending colon only then it is appropriate to give enema in this situation
by giving enema this way enema water can be made to reach maximum only till the center of transverse colon
one can not make it reach the ascending colon
it is impossible in this condition
if taking one one and half pint water one needs to clean only the rectum then this condition can be considered adequate
in this state right leg should little lax and bent
one should not allow enema water to go beyond transverse colon in appendicitis
one should not allow any kind of shock to reach wall of intestine
this state is only appropriate
because water of enema can not go diagonal further than the descending colon
making one lie down upside down lrb on the chest or on the stomach rrb
the man who has difficulty stopping water immediately has urge of defecation on taking water
for this this situation causes lot of benefit in stopping the water easily
patient had to take water in the toilet itself out of fear of expulsion of water
he was given enema in this condition on the very first day and no difficulty occurred in stopping water
anyhow due to some reason if difficulty occurs in stopping water then water also stops by keeping the anus pressed with fingers
bending the chest on knees
leaving weak man for healthy man taking enema in this situation is beneficial from many points of view
anus remains quite high as compared to intestine
from this water may reach inside descending colon very easily
along with this on water filling up fully inside descending colon one does not need to make any kind of attempt to stop water because of location of anus being little high
water remains blocked automatically by it
in this situation while taking enema one should keep small soft pad underneath the knees
by this patient will have no trouble in knees while taking enema
for healthy man whose stool has come into the rectum and one needs to use enema only to expel stool
that stool comes out by one pint normal cold water
in this state there is no need to mix anything in the water
rectum gets stimulation by this
the quantity of salt in in four pint water should be maximum two tolas and minimum one tola
brine has the property that descending colon is unable to absorb this water easily
this water staying in intestine brings help in thinning and expelling stool
mixing decoction of neem leaves this water is antiseptic
the chemical property of neem is cool therefore it reduces the additional heat of colon
destroys the worms of colon
garlic being antiseptic and because of being acrid destroys germs
quantity of garlic becoming in excess by mistake or unknowingly burning sensation in eyes occurs
heat of body increases by this
there remains chance of distress to the patient
squeezing lemon juice enema of this water helps in expelling gas
you can use minimum one or maximum two lemons in four pint water
there are two ways of mixing lemon in water
while giving enema if some water lrb one pint or half pint rrb remains then you should add lemon juice in water
this way by mixing little juice in water urge to defecate begins strongly
lemon brings lot of help in separating old stool from colon
making the patient lie on right side one should give oil to patient through syringe
after that one may give water of enema as per requirement
by making oil reach first smoothness comes in colon walls
after this water on reaching gets rid of stool easily
when there is pain in stomach because of staying in large quantity if old stool keeps pricking inside stomach there is gas in stomach and stool urine is obstructed then enema happens to be extremely useful
the patient in whose stomach enema water stops is unable to come out easily on usage oil by him also with the above mentioned method obstruction of water will reduce or not
by chance if water has stopped then because of entrance of oil in colon flatulence of colon will come out easily
by this water will also try to come out because oil is laxative substance
cause of passage of water inside not happening
sometimes while giving enema water does not enter colon
it stays where it was in the enema pot
its causes are enema stool getting stuck on mouth of enema nozzle and catheter
because of this water is unable to come out of mouth of nozzle and water stays stable where it was in the enema pot
in this condition the part of nozzle or catheter which is inside the anus
it should be moved up down slowly
the faeces that might be stuck on the mouth of the nozzle will be lost and water will start entering inside easily
the other reason is presence of stiff pieces on the anus itself
the shape and type of this stool is also of such type that it sits properly on the anal opening
on such an occasion one should take out faeces breaking it inserting the fore finger inside the anus
after this water of enema will be able to enter inside easily
when stiff stool is full in the descending part from the descending colon then there is obstruction of stool and urine both
on such an occasion one should make use enema of glycerine or any oil
one may well not be able to make all the oil inside but on the entrance of even little oil inside stimulus arises on anus from the contact of oil
from the pressure of this stimulus stool comes out
on such an occasion descending colon expands little on fomenting the stomach with hot water and stool also softens little
by this there is facilitation of entrance of water inside
in specific situation where there is swelling in the uterus and more pressure is exerted by it on the rectum then also water does not enter inside
while giving enema to an old woman even the catheter of enema did not enter straight inside it used to get twisted going little far
there was so much expansion and swelling in her uterus that from its pressure the walls of rectum had almost met each other
by pressing catheter inserting finger inside anus after taking the catheter on top of the pressed wall of rectum it enters inside easily
water entered inside only after this
enema of half to one pint of water
enema of such less water is beneficial to patient after prolonged fast or in an extremely weak condition from other reasons
by using water even little more than requirement patient will feel fatigue or water produces gas heaviness restlessness and nervousness by stopping in the descending colon
when on entering the rectum stool strongly urges the patient to defecate
if faeces is not coming out because of absence of strength of throwing faeces in intestines
only then enema of such less water would be effective
in such condition how much water should one take its decision should be made in this manner
filling up one or one and half pint water in box of enema one should start taking enema as prescribed
on entrance of water in rectum the urge to defecate will gradually increase
when urge to defecate increases so much that one can not stop its pressure then immediately stopping water of enema from going inside giving the patient pot for defecation you should induce him to defecate
you should make one defecate only on making him lie down on bed pan or rubber cloth
there is convenience in sitting and defecating only in presence of energy or agility for sitting
when rectum bloats on filling up more than necessary then its pressure is exerted on the urinary bladder
rectum and urinary bladder have an inverse relationship
hence on occurrence of extreme constipation there may be obstruction in urine
during the aforementioned obstruction use of oily water enema is the best remedy
there is possibility of delay from enema of plain water
because of lubrication of oil stool comes out easily
because of extreme constipation many small large lumps form
during this time one should keep taking catheter or nozzle completely out of anus intermittently so that lump comes out with water
sometimes lumps of weak patient stop anus
at that time entrance of water also becomes impossible
at such an occasion one should give enema only after taking stool out with the help of fingers
after entrance of water of enema in stomach of patient of extreme constipation stool starts coming out extremely fast
taking patient to the toilet or making him lie down in bed pan also becomes impossible and stool keeps coming out in between even after trying
therefore one should give enema to patient with faeces urine obstruction making him lie down on rubber sheet
in presence of strength one should give patient enema bending him on his knee chest or making him lie down flat on the back
for vaginal irrigation all other devices except nozzle are for enema only
nozzle of vaginal irrigation nozzle is slightly long and turned in circular shape and its head is bit round
there are tiny holes in it
from it water of douche entering inside like fountain cleans everything coming in contact with all parts
because of mucous membrane of vagina being extremely sensitive one should clean it with fountain nozzle
cot lrb like an enema cot rrb of vaginal irrigation may be inches long like leg
there should be round hole in the center of the cot lrb of inch or foot diameter rrb
so that water of vaginal irrigation falls only in the pots and pans kept underneath that round hole
it is necessary to take enema before vaginal irrigation so that pressure of stool obstructed in the rectum does not fall on uterus
one should use neem leaf for vaginal irrigation
to clean the uterus from inside there is convenience in releasing dirt with lukewarm water of neem leaf
normally water of vaginal irrigation should not be hotter than fahrenheit
on occurrence of swelling or pain in uterus one should bring in use fahrenheit lrb slightly rrb hot water
if there are blisters injuries and burning sensation inside the uterus then one should give vaginal irrigation of cold water of neem leaf
one should use lukewarm water in absence of burning sensation
normally after giving vaginal irrigation of hot or lukewarm water one should give vaginal irrigation of pure cold water
by this from increase in blood circulation there strength in produced in nerves
to remove uterus related diseases local blood circulation is necessary

when should you avoid enema
some people think that by going on taking enema for long time in indisposed condition one develops the habit of enema ending the natural strength of intestines to expel stool
experience has it that until there is no strength in intestines to expel stool out and one does not have an appetite because of that or starts decreasing
or other problems restlessness nervousness etc occur then enema is beneficial from the point of view of bringing help to the task of intestines
if excretion does not happen despite strong urge to defecate and because of it if an unfavourable effect takes place on disposition and health then one should take enema
otherwise in the deficiency of stool removal strength ready stool starts drying up in the rectum
sometimes its shape even starts increasing
in such condition during excretion fear of bleeding from occurrence of injury in anus remains
one should stool of patient of piles dry up
from this there is occurrence of extreme pain because of warts and weakness increases
even in the absence of urge to defecate if there is no other problem or consequence of it on appetite then in that condition there is no harm in waiting for excretion thrice or from twelve to twenty four hours
the purpose is that as much as possible one should avoid the situation of taking enema
patients may need to take enema everyday for one two months or for long time during less food intake fast or other conditions
during the days of less food or fasting stool does not come out because of adequate pressure
by increasing diet in this condition loose motions start taking place
if patient or healthy person is not having specific problem because of defecation not taking place then there is no need to worry
its cure is not enema
the right cure is this only that suitable changes are made in diet
as much as possible one should try to prevent enema
only after exhausting other remedies one should be inclined for taking enema
according to natural therapy ideally one should start lumber bath in hot water tub and end in cold water
from hot lumbar bath all parts of abdomen become soft getting hot
the blood vessels of that place expand and blood comes to the upper level of that place
later when that part is immersed in cold water
then the pores and blood vessels of that part constrict and the blood pressure that has come up goes towards the inner side
because of physical impurity blood distribution is unable to take place properly in the fine capillaries of upper and inner part of body
in that condition lumbar bath helps
the pores that are immersed in water also assist in expelling dirt becoming active through innumerable holes in the form of sweat
in all these diseases obstruction of urine uterine disorders small descending colon urinary bladder swelling in kidney pain inactivity there is benefit from hot cold lumbar bath
use of this bath is also beneficial in diseases of stones
in disease of lungs like tuberculosis asthma cold cough pleurisy etc chest wrap is the best
along with detoxifying diet giving chest wrap in the main therapy in above mentioned diseases
heart wrap is given to patients that have palpitation
hot cold fomentation on chest
in asthma cold cough pleurisy gases pain and heaviness in the place of heart etc diseases cogestion there is removed by hot cold fomentation
you should increase or decrease the measure of hot cold compress according to the life force of patient
when pain or heaviness is more then the of hot water fomentation should be normally four times more than cold water fomentation
in ordinary situation one should increase the duration of hot fomentation cold fomentation
in the end one should come down only to cold compress
on digestion diminishing the functionality of digestive system increases
but gradually decreasing hot fomentation one should come down to cold compress in the end
having stress in the fast life of today is common thing but removing it is also easy
researchers in japan have claimed that from few sips of green tea throughout the day stress can be relieved
it is significant that in many asian countries with china and japan green tea is used on large scale

the number of women taking help from doctors in sweden hong kong and netherlands is percent whereas percent in countries like norway and america
only percent in affected indian women take help from therapists
although percent women complain of interruption in their daily schedule shopping and social activities like visiting friends
dr trehan says that there are many causes of urinary incontinence but main kinds are pressure and urge
during efforts like pressure incontinence exercise coughing laughing urine comes out
it normally happens because of weakening of support of tube of urinary bladder and urethra
urge incontinence is diagnosed when patient is suddenly afflicted with the desire to urinate and is unable to stop his urine on time until he reaches the toilet
in other types of incontinence overflow incontinence is included because of which urinary bladder is always full hence urine keeps leaking
normally because of arthritis or other disorders the walking around of elderly people reduces therefore they get disorder of functional incontinence
dr mohanty says that as compared to before today there is much more effective treatment for incontinence in stopping urine
these treatments not only heal the disease but also bring back self confidence
the nature of treatment depends on control of urinary bladder seriousness of disease and lifestyle
doctors can give suggestion of easy and invaluable exercise urinary bladder exercise which helps in better control of urinary bladder
for this medicines injections special equipment and for treatment of incontinence surgical therapy is available

because of lack in moisture from the environment roughness comes in hair and scalp
because of all this roughness appears in hair also and it becomes difficult to take care of them
this is the very reason that problem of split hair also occurs
use mild shampoo but in very small amount
strong shampoos can cause damage to hair and can end their natural moisture
so scalp may lose the capacity to hold moisture
do not use very hot water to wash hair
apply conditioner after shampoo
or take such shampoo in which conditioner is included
if applying conditioner separately then spread in all the hair with fingers
if you use hair drier keep it ten inches away

it can be divided into four different categories
first light degree celsius lrb degree fahrenheit rrb moderate degree celsius lrb degree fahrenheit rrb serious degree celsius lrb degree fahrenheit rrb and lesser than degree celsius lrb degree fahrenheit rrb
to lead life smoothly many chemical processes are required
to maintain the required temperature human mind adopts many ways
when this mechanism goes wrong then instead of production of energy depreciation of energy occurs very fast
sometimes body temperature gets affected because of disease
so core temperature of body can worsen in any environment

in the first state body temperature decreases by to degrees from the normal temperature
in this condition hands of patient do not work properly
the most trouble occurs in the stomach of patient and he feels himself to be very tired

in this condition shivering becomes aggravated
blood vessels constrict
person goes yellow lips and ears go blue
when body temperature falls below degree celsius then trembling ends
during this there is trouble in speaking trouble in thinking and condition of amnesia
also cellular metabolic rate stops
on temperature becoming less than degrees skin goes blue
not only this walking becomes impossible
many body parts fail
hypothermia has been behind the success and failure of many wars

vitamins and become soluble in fats so their emission from body becomes important
adequate amount of fat is only necessary for body but it should not be removed from one diet
the quantity of fat calorie that is taken in diet should not be ten percent more than the total amount of calories that is taken
body needs fat in less amount
fat is necessary in diet so that important hormones can form and absorption of soluble vitamins becomes possible in fats

under an achievement that science world has received australian scientists have claimed that they have found new way to control dengue fever
it is significant that more than deaths occur worldwide with dengue fever
university of queensland and team of researchers have found that lifespan of mosquitoes that spread dengue can be reduced by infecting with bacteria wolbachia
head researcher scott has said in study published in prominent journal of the science world sale that by this chances of mosquitoes infecting humans will diminish
they have said that under this startling progress they found that wolbachia infected mosquitoes have resistance from pathogens that spread other diseases including dengue chikungunya and malaria
researcher said that it means that the mainly proposed process of dengue control can be much more effective as compared to before and it can be applied to many other diseases in future
scientists have to say that vital substance for humans vitamin can also be used for producing stem cells with the aim of treating diseases
maximum accidents take place worldwide because of lack of sleep
other than this insomnia can not only damage the profit of employer but also affects the health and happiness of the employee

hormone secreted from pineal gland has control on sleeping method
it may be irregular in many forms like it happens in women during pre menopausal period
its secretion is less in old age although recent researches raise questions on it
daylight unnatural light lrb thorough lights in office rrb or climatic disturbances put obstacles in it
other than this stimulants relaxants medicines sleeping pills also perform the same function
addiction to sleeping pills also provoke it because body becomes habituated to it
exercising or eating just before sleeping reading or watching thrillers that absorb energy keep us awake
it has been found in researches that the people who were afflicted with unsettled sleep in them high levels of stress hormone adrenocorticotrophic hormone lrb acth rrb and cortisol were present
such used to happen not only while awake but also while sleeping
researchers have found dangerous results of it which were cause of obesity reduction in muscular density depression loss of memory osteoporosis diabetes blood pressure in the group of researchers

eating dessert before sleeping produces ups and downs in blood sugar level which harms sleep
drinking lot of water or drinking fluid before bed is responsible for keeping yourself up because you have to go for urination

it is true the more you eat you can eat more than that
your stomach is naturally in the shape of your closed fist
as single muscle it expands and contracts according to use
when it is full it expands
when it is empty it returns towards its initial shape
you have just finished you lunch in office and your colleagues give you huge laddu of god offering and you take it with complete faith after some time secretary reaches you with plate of samosa and gulab jamun because his son has scored good marks in board exams
you eat that also and after that drink cup of hot tea because your point is that it will digest everything
after that you will go home will take some snacks and savouries with tea
after some time it will be time for dinner
it is daily routine in which there is nothing new
although when you develop the habit of eating lot of food then muscles of stomach lose their natural flexibility and size of stomach actually starts increasing hence more than necessary food increases the size of stomach
in turn this increased capacity of stomach instigates the tendency to eat more than necessary
it is somewhat like this if stomach is small then you will feel it to be full soon
in people with big stomach nerves of stomach do not allow brain to suspect fulfilment until food is available in large amount hence people with large stomach need more food to feel full which is way more than their need
some obesity specialists believe that in two to four weeks after eating more than necessary size of stomach starts expanding
most of us are acquainted with the feeling of hunger the next day after eating very well in party of the previous night
keep in mind it could be the first step of expansion of shape of stomach but it is also true that if you want you can contract the muscles of your stomach
no matter how impossible it may seem research shows that it is possible to contract stomach to its actual size
reducing amount of food in every meal reduces the daily expansion of stomach and it contracts with time
along with this itself the quantity of food that makes you feel fulfilment also reduces
people who diet think that by leaving food they can reduce calories
actually leaving food is form of hunger strike and by doing this you eat more than necessary food in the next meal
after waking up in the morning your metabolism starts with the first meal
on not having breakfast your metabolism does not start until lunch
it means that you lose hours of reducing fats
remember that you stay hungry your metabolism slows down hence eat healthy fat free food and your metabolism will reduce accumulated fat
you stomach can contract or expand even after one meal
it depends on the amount of food
when you eat little every hours and do not eat more than necessary then your stomach slowly starts contracting on its own
research shows that instead of eating big meals one can reduce the size of stomach by percent by eating small meals
according to pennsylvania state university survey the bigger the serving size is the more you eat
gradually reduce the portion of your meal
when these portions reduce steeply then stomach stays little hungry and sends signals of hunger to the brain
if portions of food are reduced slowly then stomach contracts without any problem
order for small plate or eat with someone else
you will feel satisfaction
remember that pleasure of one bite can also be just as fulfilling as swallowing glass full of ice cream hastily
your stomach mouth and mind are all connected to each other and after chewing for minutes your stomach sends this signal to the brain that you have become satisfied
to reduce weight satisfactorily and successfully you will have to eat slowly for minutes or more
one way is that you keep the spoon or fork down after every bite
enjoy the bite and pick up the spoon again only after you have swallowed the whole bite
stomach gets full soon from the food which is full of enough amount of fiber like chapatti whole pulses salad etc
it means that in this case your stomach gives the signal of contentment to the brain even before eating lot of food
for active metabolism or reducing accumulated fats water is needed in lot of quantity
before having your meal drink large glass of iced water
coolness contracts your stomach little and you feel full soon
all that goes on in your head and all that you think starts being true
positive behavior and optimistic point of view will make the process of losing weight simple and fast
stay away from negative thinking
negative feelings like fear depression anxiety remorse and anger urge to eat more
in recent years bypass surgery is getting popular in the east
this surgery converts the capacity of stomach to the size of glass smaller than bottle and detoxifies the small intestine
within year patients lose more than percent of their weight
specialists warn that gastric bypass is big surgery which should not be taken lightly
in percent cases operation becomes unsuccessful
in percent cases blood clot in lungs pneumonia infection leakage from repaired intestinal passage etc complications occur
in out of cases death may occur
doctors advice for gastric surgery only in those cases where obesity is big problem
they say that good sleep is necessary for good health
sleeping adequately itself is called the cure for many diseases
if you believe the experts then your health condition may be guessed from the period of your sleep
why is good sleep necessary and how does is affect our health know
during sleep only brain performs the task of organising lrb memory rrb the incidents of the day so that when necessary information can be used in the right place
it is significant that sleep is also included in the training of world champion athletes
during sleep only repair of bones and muscles inside body is possible
hence it is important that you sleep well so that you do not have to face any kind of problem
in sleep not getting complete or in lack of sleep chance of accident while driving increases
do not drive on its occurrence
lack of good sleep becomes cause of metabolic diseases and hormonal disorder
it is remarkable that by waking up recurrently secretion of hormones get affected
prevent these tea coffee at night and alcohol in large amount
while sleeping scenes on tv that startle or distress
by sleeping wearing tight clothes or on dirty bed
in the context of joints operations of knees and hips are mainly taken into account
in the place of deformed hips and joints joint replacement is successful and safe surgery
it is true that in winters joints pain is too much
as long as joints are concerned one can do surgery of deformed knees and hips in any season
this because now all standards of facilities have changed
now surgery happens in completely air conditioned operation theater
rooms are also air conditioned
hence one can get successful joints related surgery done in months of january or june too
no matter which season there is no effect on the process of operation
besides all this one aspect of truth is also that injuries heal in the winter season much too fast as compared to the summer season
as compared to summer situations of occurrence of infection also decrease in winters
so one also has to give less medicines to the patient and patients too get better too soon
in summers there is more use of antibiotics and patient also has to take more precautions
anorexia nervosa is disease occurring often in adolescent girls
in this disease fear of getting fat pervades the heart of patient
patient thinks that he she is too fat
therefore patients start making cutback in their food
as result they become victims of malnutrition

those who get restless soon and are unable to make the right decisions are not paying attention to their fitness in my opinion
hence it is important that focussing your mind and body you exercise
exercising is my hobby
this is the very reason that exercise as soon as wake up
not only your body but your mind also becomes strong from regular exercise and you can handle yourself even in difficult situation
by going on taking the required amount of rub anar times day excess thirst weakness of liver complaints of eating mud or coal get away
the total mount of iron in body is grams
in this about iron is coupled with hemoglobin in red blood cells
about iron is stored in various tissues in the form of ferretin and hemosiderin
one finds the problem of iron deficiency in about half the population of the world
it has become known from researches that more than half men and two third women in our country are afflicted with anemia
tissues get damaged from excess of iron also even death can occur
an adult needs mg of iron everyday
iron is in abundance in eggs fish
we call this iron haem iron
its absorption from intestines is about whereas iron is also present in green leafy vegetables cereals pulses their absorption by intestines happens with less ease
so possibility of iron deficiency in vegetarians is more
absorption of iron from intestines depends on iron stored in body
amount of iron in body being less its absorption by intestines increases whereas being more it decreases
if absorbed iron in intestines is in free form then its extremely harmful it is insoluble and is unable to be used in body
in blood iron remains attached to protein transferrin
is used in bone marrow red blood cells for production of hemoglobin
it enters cells through blood and stays attached to ferretin protein in cells in this form iron is soluble and less harmful
body can use them on occurrence necessity
if amount of ferretin increases in cells then it converts to insoluble hemosidrine which can be harmful for body
about one gram iron in body is stored mainly in liver cells and macrophage
on occurrence of necessity of iron stored in body body uses it
one can detect the excess or deficiency of iron from blood iron level transferrin and ferretin in body
deficiency of iron in body can be because of its absence in sufficient amount in food absorption of iron present in vegetarian food happens with less ease so possibility of deficiency is more
requirement of iron increases in childhood youth pregnancy
so if it is not consumed in additional amount then there may be deficiency
because of less absorption of iron in old age possibility of occurrence of anemia can increase
if iron comes out of body with blood by bleeding even then deficiency of iron occurs in body
deficiency of iron also occurs by occurrence of infection of blood sucking hookworms in intestines excessive bleeding during periods in women bleeding from intestines or other parts of body
in the poverty line special danger of iron deficiency remains in children women elderly people that do not drink milk
in the second trimester of pregnancy somewhat all women become victims of iron deficiency
in the second trimester of pregnancy somewhat all women become victims of iron deficiency
if iron pills capsules are consumed for long time in large amount or more iron reaches inside body from other reasons then it starts accumulating in the various body parts of body specially liver muscles of heart endocrinal glands
by which tissues get damaged
tissues get damaged by the effect of active free radical being produced because of excess of iron
when more blood needs to be put up at regular intervals because of thalassemia sickle cell anemia etc then iron starts accumulating in body in larger amount
in some individuals absorption of iron from intestines happens in excessive amount because of which there may be excess of iron in body
this disease is often hereditary because of abnormality in genes
we call this disease haemosiderosis
on entrance of iron in large amount in body spots occur on skin
diabetes can occur from pancreas getting damaged
cirrhosis may occur from damaged liver danger of liver cancer increases
the seminal vesicles of men may get destroyed
weakness fatigue occurs can become impotent weight decreases swelling and pain occurs in joints nausea vertigo occur
size of liver may increase hair falls abdominal fluid retention may occur heart diseases may occur
test of excess of iron can be measure of transferrin ferretin levels biopsy of liver
iron being in excess can be fatal hence to expel it from body injections of ferrol are given regularly
this treatment is difficult and extremely expensive
now medicine that makes iron from body ineffective which can also be eaten in the form of capsule has been developed
hopefully it will soon be available in our country as well
in patients of hereditary homosiderosis ml blood is taken out every week so that there may be no excess of iron
by this treatment there remains no chance of death from their heart liver diseases
nowadays one hears it said often that so and so person has got allergy
the more the use of modern synthetic medicines is increasing the more outbreak of allergy is going on increasing
diseases have been mentioned in ayurveda by the names of sheetpitta udard and kotha they are included in allergies of today
allergy or sheetapitta is reaction of body which is produced by touching or eating those substances that are unfavourable to the constitution of people
being favourable to the constitution is called shastra satmya and unfavourable is called asatmya
some people get an allergy from wearing clothes made of synthetic thread
these people develop symptoms of allergy from consumption of some special english medicines breathing speed increases
nerve becomes weak and even death occurs from shock and nervousness
these medicines becoming asatmya can also become marak deadly for people
those who get an attack of sheetpitta or allergy should immediately use medicine if they themselves do not succeed in arrangements then they without losing time they should send in good hospital or doctor

new research of aiims has claimed that after donating kidney donor women remain happier as compared to such men
the associate professor of department of surgical disciplines of aiims sandeep guleria has said that after donating kidney he wanted to do an assessment of level qol of life of donor
we found that after donating kidney considerable improvement came in the qol of donor
prof guleria said that out of these too more improvement came in qol of women donors as compared to men donors especially in the qol of mothers and wives
on being asked the reason of research guleria said we have learned that in most cases women are donating kidneys
out of these many were married many unmarried some living in live in relationships some married but divorced or windowed
since possibility of donation of kidney of mothers and wives is more hence we wanted to know that the reason of kidney donation of other women is love or they are compelled to do so
guleria has told that for doing so we did survey with the medium of questionnaire
in which research of physical and mental health and social acceptance of donor was done
total of donors were included in this research in which were women
they said that we asked them lot of questions
we asked that are they happy after donating kidney the options of which were not at all not very much little bit and completely happy

after hypnobirth water birth aroma therapy reflexology and scientology methods of labor pain relief now trend of epidural anaesthesia is growing rapidly
the reason for it is that where one gets some relief from pain in other methods there itself mother stays percent free from pain even in consciousness
given benefits and demand of this technique not only is its experiment being used in all big hospitals but recently it has been started in aiims as well
doctors have to say that despite awareness being less nowadays about women ask for such methods
senior gynaecologist dr asha sharma of rockland hospital says that the most important path of pain signal is the backbone
signal reaches brain from here itself through nervous
anaesthetics stop this signal in the backbones even before it reaches the brain
in routine anaesthesia the injection is given directly in the spinal cord by which patient faints
but in epidural injection is applied in such canal of the lower part of spinal cord that patient does get pain relief but her and the foetus both remain fully conscious and are also able to move hands feet
during the delivery anesthetic keep talking to the woman
however during delivery woman is unable to apply pressure on the lower part
dr sharma says that if epidural anaesthesia is given at the right time with the help of an expert anesthetic then this method is completely safe
they start given anaesthesia when cervix has open to centimetres
former head gynaecologist department of pant hospital dr neera agarwal says that this method is new for this place but it is being used in foreign countries for many years
this facility should start in all government hospitals because an expenditure of just till three thousand more occurs in it
but due to lack of resources related to anaesthesia and operation theater this is unable to start
dr agarwal says that there may be some risk in condition of not getting the epidural anaesthesia in the right way at the right time
meaning blood pressure of woman reducing suddenly by this heartbeat of foetus may slow down for little while
in some people symptoms of acute headache breathing problem head reeling on getting up may also occur
in condition of getting anaesthesia in the wrong canal the complete lower half of patient may get paralysed and there may be danger to the child in such condition
according to dr agarwal body comes in complete control two to four hours after delivery and like normal delivery patient can also go home after few hours

in general there are three major reasons behind diseases which are listed below
increase in heat
increase in cold
reduction in digestive process
because of increase in heat the patient feels burning restlessness thirst dryness nervousness etc
the affected place is hot
the patient has special wish to get cold
such symptoms occur in body because of the excess of red color
the nerves of the patient contract because of the increase in cold
there is more urine
the stool becomes thin and yellowness pervades throughout the body
cough begins to come out through the mouth nose
the patient feels comfortable in heat
such symptoms occur in body because of the excess of blue color
the deficiency of yellow colou comes because of the fluids of body not forming properly
if the metals are not able to form properly in the body and they remain raw then considering it to be deficiency of yellow color the arrangements should be made to send that very color in the body
in ayurveda system vaata pitta and kapha have the same principle
that also is similar to these diseases

depression of cold psychologists believe that many reasons are responsible for producing depression
it can arise out of any one or more causes reactive neurotic psychological or side effect of eating medicine
even experts had not guessed that one cause of depression can also be weather
but now this thing has emerged that during those days when winters are acute people may get depressed
and depression thriving because of weather can remain until winters it can not be removed by ordinary medicines

an important thing that most people do not know is that rate of metabolism in winters slows as compared to summers and if our eating habits remain same as summer season or amount of food drinks increases little in winters then physical weight and fatness increasing during these days is natural
its reason is that in winters the direction of body temperature happens to be towards fall also this side because of less physical work due to extreme cold there is less expenditure of energy whereas more energy is obtained from having more food
this very remaining energy increases obesity accumulating in the fatty places of body
the meaning of obesity increasing is that the limited amount of blood present in body reaching that part of body which has increased because of eating much food
because of this brain is unable to get the amount of blood which is required as result brain is unable to get oxygen and nutritious substances glucose etc is sufficient amount
hence it is important that to prevent depression one adopts limited and balanced meals and follows the following things strictly
having breakfast is very important since it becomes to hour long fast because of sleeping at night by which level of glucose in body becomes very low
since consumption of energy begins as soon as one wakes up therefore it is important that one has breakfast in such way that to work there is no lack of energy until lunch

environment contaminated with toxic substance named mptp that is produced from narcotic heroin also produces diseases like parkinson
other than this not taking nutritious diet can also be basic cause of this disease
vitamins minerals and enzymes present in nutritious meal work like the anti oxidants that make free radicals inactive
in absence of nutritious diet activity of free radicals remains increased
because of all the above reasons brain cells begin to deteriorate prematurely and there is production of parkinson disease meaning kampvata

the whole game is of mind
it might well not be visible but whatever life we lead or whatever we do that is decided on the basis and in accordance to this mind itself
we surely walk with our legs but what makes us walk is our mind
like mind like life
hence it has also been said that when the mind wins is victory as the mind loses its defeat
not only this doctors also have this to say that in the diseases happening to human evident or evidently it the contribution of mind only
most diseases occur because of illness of mind only even to treat disease of some person more than medicines his desire power is required hence human needs to remain more healthy psychologically than physically
specialists have to say that human needs psychologist more than medicine
research and conditions tell us that it is the disease of mind only that does not allow human to live fully
our body falls sick later we fall sick by our mind first
truth is that the we overlook our mind just as much as we take care of our body its beauty
we procure best cosmetics best technique better diet excellent environment lifestyle environment etc for our body but leave procuring for mind we do not even want to think anything
think about yourself
most people think that if we think about ourselves we will become selfish therefore they keep moulding their life according to others and keep doing kindnesses to become good
doing this is not wrong but do not keep yourself so busy also that you do not even get the chance to think about yourself
spare some such time during the day when you think only about yourself and focus on this thing that in the whole day what and how much you have done for your pleasure and satisfaction
complete your interests
draw some solid conclusions after thinking about yourself
definitely fulfil those interests after doing which you feel like you have done something
the desires and interests that you have been unable to fulfil do those wear and eat something of your choice go out places make friends etc
finish tasks
half done tasks also give stress in whose presence you are unable to focus on new tasks and burden of old tasks does not allow to finish new tasks
finish tasks because take some new task or responsibility only when old are finished and make timetable to finish old tasks
bring change in your routine
such routine causes boredom to mind because of which mind stays sad
take little break from the regular tasks and routine of home office and do something different
do not tie yourself in some responsibility try not to do that which you do everyday or change the time and place of doing those tasks
go out
the best way to change your mood is that you definitely go out somewhere at the end of the week or month for couple of days
we can neither change home or office nor can we renew the faces and environment that we see near us according to us for this it is important that you go out somewhere and give your mind new environment new atmosphere so that mind is able to get peace
talk to others
not only does mind get lighter on talking to others but we also get new medium of looking at understanding life
not only this we get to know from the medium of conversation that the one in front is also sad only we are not sad
this very knowledge and comparison often helps us get out of our grief
while talking to others if possible write your diary
do not just write your diary also read it at the end of every week and on reading compare your state mind
focus on this thing that which thing was important in life which less unimportant
who we gave how much priority and why
which are those things that we did unnecessarily
what are those demands and desires without which also life can go on properly
what could we have done and what we could not do etc
read all think and test
on doing this not only will heart be lighter but you will be able to direct yourself
listen to good music
often we listen to music in compulsion or because of necessity then it is in wedding ceremony or dance party
according to your comfort neither do you get the chance nor do you look for the chance to listen to music of your liking
truth is that even music has an effect on our mind brain
making list of your favorite songs fill them in cassette or cd and sparing time listen to those songs according to mood
listen to some such songs also that give you inspiration to live and understand your loneliness
have plain satvik meals
they say like food like mind meaning our minds becomes the kind of food we eat
hence if possible eat fresh pure plain satvik food and take balanced meal
eat food chewing well and allow it to digest well
cry openly
often people hide their tears or with the shame that what will people say hence do not cry openly
truth is that because of not being able to cry openly various kinds of defects arise in us like anger irritability stubbornness etc
because of which our mind and life get influenced and often we end up doing harm to ourselves with our own hands
not being able to cry or for not being to cry openly we produce so much pent up energy inside us that we do not even hesitate to commit suicide
therefore whenever tears come by any excuse allow them to come
have deep sleep
sleep is not just an activity for physical rest for removing physical fatigue but after having good and deep sleep mind also gets lighter and fresh
muscles get rest
sitting idle means keeping your mind empty giving your mind chance to wander
hence keep doing something or the other
keep yourself busy so that mind also stays in work
we mostly do every task for profit or money
do some tasks for satisfaction of your mind as well
especially apply your energy in creative tasks like dance sing paint
do gardening pet animals and take care of them do stitching sewing etc
definitely create something or the other
by doing this not only is mind focussed in work but it also stays satisfied that we have done something and we also become successful in refining on extracting many hidden gifts
yoga and meditation is good medium for fixing mind
through the medium of meditation not only does mind get focussed but we also get chance to thing right wrong about ourselves
not only do our senses get active from yoga but also get in control
existing chakras in our body get active from yoga which are helpful in purifying our mind and psychology
prevent anxiety
they say anxiety is like pyre
it is anxiety only because of which human is always sad and is unable to live the way he wants hence keep yourself away from that company who compel us to get into habit of something and in its imprisonment start destroying us
write all your problems anxieties and complications then enlist them according to priority and sort them out which anxiety is valid and which you have produced without reason
you will find that other than one two all are useless
after choosing anxieties think why certain worry is there and what am doing to be free of this worry
then pick up paper and pen and write on it your daily tasks and their priority you will find that you are not doing anything to be free of your anxieties and your energy is getting spent uselessly in thinking only
hence categorise your anxieties and problems solve them according to priority and keep your mind healthy
prevent drugs
if possible save yourself from any kind of intoxication then be it beedi cigarette or tobacco alcohol etc
intoxication not only affects physical health but taking possession of our mind does not allow it to work properly and getting out of control it goes against us only and does not allow us to live properly
make entertainment an important part of your life
do not make it medium of mere time pass
look for excuses to make yourself happy
sometimes do some things getting away from your age and position meaning do not think that you have grown older or that you have started working on high post so can not jump and play like children
party with friends allies without reason or go out on trip
do not take life seriously but with fun
truth is that if you want to keep mind healthy then pay attention to its demand
do some things for mind as well when mind will get life like that of mind only then body will be able stay healthy
express anger
one cause of remaining patient of mind is held anger pent up energy frustrations etc
if all this appears at the right time or gets out then mind can become light and sound
yell to get this held still energy out
look for lonely spot and going there say all those things without affectation which you have suppressed inside you for long time
mind will get light by doing this
if on doing this also anger does not ebb then take pillow and pound it with your complete strength
during the pounding repeat all those things inside your mind which bother you
do retrospection meaning look at old things again
to keep mind healthy definitely look at your old things from time to time
then they could be old greeting cards kept in your cupboard or letters gifts or photo album
do retrospection of prizes certificates or accomplishments
awaken the strength inside you along with comparison nurture your lost self confidence and disappointed mind with previous achievements
see and accept changes in letters and cards etc
time and circumstances never remain the same
change is rule of nature
just as its realisation occurs mind stops complaining and starts getting healthy

the blurring of natural lens of eyes is itself called cataract
according to the director of centre for sight the senior eye disease specialist dr mahipal sachdev this problem normally occurs only on aging
however often the cause of cataract may also be some kind of trauma or metabolic disorder like diabetes hypothyroid or occurrence of swelling in eyes
blurred vision color appearing faded or color not appearing clear eyes getting sensitive towards strong light or sunlight less vision at night occurrence of more trouble in eyes at night etc are its symptoms
according to them kind of protein is found in the crystalline lens of our eyes as we age this lens starts becoming opaque also because of many chemical changes in this protein which later produces cataract in our eyes
they have to say that that its main cause is that light is unable to enter their eyes
its treatment happens through operation
they have to say that there is very deep relationship between cataract and blood pressure if blood pressure increases before or during the eye operation of the patient then conducting the operation in such state is not possible hence it is very important for blood pressure to remain regulated
they have to say that ability to identify light in dark area and things based on subtle differences in the background is contrast sensitive

it helps in focussing rays of light on retina from which an image forms and we are successful in seeing it
they inform us that if multifocal iol of patient is done with fecoemulsification then one does not need to wear glasses after surgery
on the other hand if you do fecoemulsification with monofocal iol then it becomes important to use spectacles while studying anything

kidney keeps control on blood pressure lrb bp rrb makes many kinds of hormones which maintains water content in the body the balance of acids and by which blood pressure remains normal
having high blood pressure is considered to be symptom of the suffering illness of the kidney
the production of red blood cells in blood occurs with the help of hormones called crithropiotin in the bone marrow
in the situation of failure of the kidney this substance is produced less or is not produced at all by which the production of red blood cells becomes less and situation of anemia develops
the kidneys help lot in keeping the bones strong

reading all this my curiosity went on increasing and read all the texts which could be available related to linseed and also read at length about the research carried out on linseed
was very happy that this linseed whose name also we had forgotten is so very lucrative for health
then what myself began the use of linseed and kept inspiring my patients for also eating linseed

if rh protein lrb antigen rrb are found in the red cells of people then they are called rh positive lrb rh ve rrb
if rh protein lrb antigen rrb are not found in the red cells of people then they are called rh negative lrb rh ve rrb
percent indians are rh positive and percent are rh negative

in this age of science and technology also today malnutrition and are leaving their effects but the fight against malnutrition is continuing by researchers and doctors
complete it
the main reason of malnutrition is the lack of strength which is obtained from energy filled meals
in this kind of meal food protein minerals etc are found in proper amounts
these elements are found in balanced amounts in spirulina
along with supplying the balanced food spirulina also does the diagnosis of many diseases
the most important protein in spirulina is which is found till percent whereas protein in such quantity is not found in any other plant
out of ten amino acids important for the body eight are found in spirulina and because of its protein being soluble in water approximately percent gets absorbed in the body
vitamin calcium magnesium potassium sodium and phosphate are found in spirulina which give it the status of complete food
its first use was done for malnourished children and infected women which was successful
during this time this came to be known that spirulina is also helpful in the diagnosis of other diseases
the researchers worldwide proved this that spirulina is also effective in pancreas related thyroid hepatitis cholesterol diabetes arthritis and night blindness
in the africa continent spirulina has been proven successful in fighting with malnutrition of children in plentiful
these are some special kinds of weed found in lakes which by meeting in
spirulina spreads on the surface of the water of the ramgarh and jalmahal lake of rajasthan by october month
according to world social report in the backward classes of india percent children are weigh less
according to the report children in every thousand become victims of death at birth only and children become by the time they are years of age

spirulina has been found capable of fighting with situations these days only
it has also been found useful in cancer and hiv prevention
the youth must not remain in this that only aging people can get heart attacks
statistics and research done by experts show that among people coming in the grip of heart attack now the number of youth less than years is increasing rapidly
saif ali khan had to be admitted to the hospital some time back owing to problem related to heart then the severe heart attack of fashion designer rohit bal
the signal is clear that the youth is rapidly moving towards heart related problems
big reason for this is their bad lifestyle
study done by the all india institute of medical sciences lrb aiims rrb is enough to shock
the study shows that the rate high blood pressure obesity and heart related diseases in the youth is increasing rapidly
especially the youth living in the cities are coming fast in its grip
according to doctors the fast lifestyle of the youth living in cities fatty food and the increasing use of alcohol is responsible for this because of which the matter of obesity high blood pressure and diabetes is increasing among the youth
research shows that in such cases the condition of the metropolitan youth is alarming
complete it
according to the study of the world health organization the most heart patients in the country are in delhi after kerala
in these people of middle class are more
till ten twelve years before people used to think this that the problem of heart disease blockage in the arteries of the heart is less in india in comparison to the whole world
but in various studies and researches this is known that in comparison to the western countries percent of people in india are afflicted with heart disease
without doubt this is matter of grave importance
before where the possibility of heart disease between to years of age was sketched today this possibility has reduced and is found in people of years of age and less
the heart diseases which happen to people in america at the age of they begin among the people here years before
there are many reasons of this
today in the country in less than years of age the problem of heart disease is increasing rapidly
this rate is seen increasing rapidly towards youth of years
it is obvious the biggest reason of this is only and only the fast changing lifestyle
in reality the rate of coronary heart related disease in indians especially in the youth has begun to be found to be almost three times more in comparison to western countries
today the craze of smoking can be seen to be in many of the youth
in the form of base the bad effects of smoking have been recorded not only in india but on the international level also
according to the who nearly billion people in the world smoke in which one third are of the age of
dr trehan says in the matter of the ill effects of smoking professional people smoke because they feel that by this their tension will dissipate but they ignore that fact by which has come forward that this gives bad effect on their health
there are harmful things like nicotine and tar in cigarettes and carbon monoxide is enough for destroying the heart
normally in our country fried food is consumed in which cholesterol and carbohydrates are more
in things like pakora jalebi samosa these elements are found more
actually our food habits are proheart disease
low density cholesterol meaning ldc is also the result of deteriorating habits of food
this only pushes us towards the high risk zone of heart related diseases
because of these habits only the cholesterol deposited in the veins start making them narrow
as result by this the supply of blood received by the heart gets affected and the possibilities of heart attack take hold
it is not difficult to control the increasing heart diseases on the youth and children
only some things need to be kept in mind
everyday for minutes do brisk walk walk fast
keep control on the diet
use such an oil in food which does not solidify
there comes restriction in the flow of blood by it solidifying in the veins
there is less cholesterol in olive oil or saffola
one can see the physical exertion getting less in city people
most people go in cars
lifts are provided in buildings
walking on foot is almost not present
frequently people can not understand that they have heart diseases
they see it in the form of gas production or some other problem but for knowing this that there is no problem coming this can be understood in three forms
in step the beginning of the heart disease has started but the patient has not known
there was no harm to the patient also
in step there is some chagrin while doing some work anger comes or feel some pressure or burning on the chest on running then it can be angina
when you feel such symptoms then get warned and get check up done immediately
step is the most dangerous and comes forward in the form of heart attack
in this the patient does not only know that there was the reason of angina or on knowing also he had ignored it
in such cases the danger of heart attacks increases percent in which the life of the person may be lost
in these percent of the matters are not able to reach the hospital even
that is why one must remain very careful
if there is pain in the chest then do not delay in going to the hospital
no symptom of enzyma appears in the patients of diabetes
no warning is received from the side of the body
their nerves become numb because of diabetes
such people must always get their check up done
in such youth whose parents have had problems of the heart in them the possibility of these problems emerging in small age can remain
meaning if its fear has been expressed on medical basis after the age of then such people may have this problem in the age of also
if one person has problems like cholesterol blood pressure and diabetes then he comes in the high risk category
it is dangerous to have good cholesterol less than and bad cholesterol more than
such people who smoke cigarettes more then become more careful
it is not right for blood pressure to be more than
because of thickness coming in the blood also due to clots depositing problems increase in the heart
because of deteriorated lifestyle people become stressed and for getting instant relief from tension take the support of smoking and alcohol
after the blood pressure getting haywire gradually heart related diseases take birth and one does not get to know
in depression the person feels like eating again and again because of which excess fat starts depositing in the body and the danger of heart attack increases
these people who are habituated to eating western food and drinks they should get their check up done because there is more sugar and salt in western food by which flab increases
after menopause the danger of heart attack emerges because the veins of the heart remain fit because of the estrogens hormones secreted by the ovaries that is why women have more danger after the age of
therefore after the age of get regular check ups done
specialists related with the diseases of the heart say that along with keeping the food habits better one should get the habit of regular exercise
your family history must also be checked
if there has been history in the family of heart related diseases then one should get checked in three or six months
anyway in the lifestyle of today people of up should get check done on the display of any such symptoms
ecg lrb electrocardiogram rrb ecg is the safest test method
in actuality heart disease specialists keep an eye on the proper functioning of the heart on its basis
tmt lrb tread mill test rrb when enough is not understood about coronary heart disease by ecg then tmt test is done
eco cardiogram for measuring the speed of the beats of the heart this check is done
by this test only this approximation is done that in doing surgical or medical treatment how much jolt can the heart take
in these two other types of tests are also done
transesophageal echocardiogram lrb tee rrb in this test the pipe going from the neck to the stomach is tested because this pipe passes close to the heart
this check is done on the coming of the need of any surgical treatment
stress ecocardiogram by this test heart wall and its pumping work is seen
this test is done immediately before and after exercise
angiography by the medium of this test the percentage of blockage is found
doctors have to say that there is some risk in this test and it is little more expensive also
the people for whom the situation of angioplasty or bypass surgery arises they are asked to do this test frequently
cholesterol test during the time of any problem in the heart the doctor gives the advise of correcting the cholesterol level of the heart
there is check for this also
in this order there is another test which is called homocysteine test
its level must be from to
in this only there is test lpa
in these tablets of nicotine are given
apart from this the doctor also does the check of sugar level bp etc
according to doctors there is direct relation of the rise and fall of sugar and blood pressure with diseases
many fears remain in the mind about the bypass surgery used in the treatment of heart diseases
what is this after all
according to doctors heart fails due to the disfunctioning of the heart valve blood pressure increase increase of muscles of the heart and by weakening of the heart
if there is treatment on time then one can be saved
the blockage in the vein of the heart lrb coronary artery rrb is called coronary artery disease lrb cad rrb
this blockage is due to the deposition of fat by which the vein becomes hard
the possibility of heart attack increases on the completing closing of the vein
of the three major veins of the heart barriers can be formed in any one or all
in such situation in the operation vein is taken out from any part of the body and connected to the vein of the heart
this newly connected nerve starts blood flow automatically in the vein
many people feel that sick veins are taken out and new veins are attached that is wrong belief
sick veins are not taken out instead in that vein new vein is attached in front of the block or restriction the blood flow remains intact itself by this
in the matter of artery blockage bypass surgery is the best option
initially bypass surgery was done by stopping the heartbeats
by this there used to be an effect on other parts kidney liver lungs etc
now with new method beating heart surgery only that place of the heart is stopped where surgery has to happen
in the previous method seven eight bottles of blood was required in the surgery of the heart whereas in beating heart surgery one to two bottles of blood is enough
the patient also gets discharged from the hospital in seven days
in the new techniques of bypass surgery beating heart surgery is successful
by this the patients have less difficulty and they get discharged from the hospital in seven days
friends for achieving success it is very essential to wake early morning

eating according to necessity does not mean this that one thing should be eaten more
there is no one food which can fulfil the needs of your body or your strength
that is why there is necessity of variance in your food
eating that same one type of food all the time we limit the nutritious elements in our diet
so for balanced diet we should choose some foods from the main food groups everyday
grains like rice roti doubleroti etc they give strength for play and work
pulses and milk give us protein and help us in growing
fruits and vegetables give us vitamin minerals and fibers
apart from fruits and vegetables we get fiber from grains like wheat oatmeal etc
we get help in digesting properly by fibers
for staying healthy and for growing properly fats like ghee is important
but by too much fat in the diet obesity heart attacks and some types of cancer can also happen
that is why eat things fried in oil processed cheese lrb paneer rrb butter cream ice cream and chocolate etc least
by eating too many sweets harm can befall your teeth and decay too
this makes you fat and lazy
this is true that for growing and for working you need strength
for this if you eat roti rice potato yam etc and do little abstinence from white sugar jaggery sugar then it will be better
after eating it is good to take less sweet things and les or absolutely no sugar in milk tea or coffee
juice of fruits are much better than soft drinks like cola
steam pressure baking or cooking by roasting is better than boiling because by this beneficial substances can be saved in the food
for working and taking the enjoyment of life there should be strength in the body
the body gets this energy by eating
lrb calorie energy of eating rrb if we eat more than the necessity of our body then it will deposit on our body as fat
after working reading exercise illness for reaching the previous condition and growing along with fuel there is also the necessity of nutrition
it is best for the health not to smoke
there are more than harmful and toxic chemical substances in the smoke of tobacco like nicotine tar carbon monoxide etc
cigarette bidi hukka chilum pipe are also harmful
similar to cocaine heroin and other addictive substances there is nicotine poison in tobacco which is an addictive thing
on the addiction of nicotine coming once man starts being dependent on it and can not leave its habit easily
that is why people who are smokers have difficulty in leaving smoking
the smoke of tobacco harms your body and cancer of lungs throat etc heart disease and are the reason of lung diseases of long duration like bronchitis asthma etc
by this tolerance power is also lost
by this infertility can also occur
if you want to remain active and fit then say no to smoking
do not be influenced by your friends or by advertisements of cigarettes
do not let the eagerness of smoking dominate over yourself
smoker also has bad effect on people near him
burning cigarette or bidi throws smoke outside in the air then it increases the amount of smoke in the air
the people sitting in that room also take this smoke in their lungs
they become passive smokers
the meaning of it is this that other people who are not smoking also even then the harmful effect of cigarette happens on their lungs and heart
this way the person who smokes causes harm to the members of his family friends and people near him
out of young people who smoke will in the end die from diseases happening due to tobacco
out of young people who smoke will die in middle age only
normally in comparison to non smokers they reduce years of their life
smokers will die in old age but they will have remained sick with diseases happening due to tobacco
if smokers can make up their minds they can leave it
for this there is the necessity of mental strength and determination
the attachment of this addiction puts him in difficulty many times but with his trying and the help of his family and friends can achieve victory over this
tobacco is harmful in any form
by chewing tobacco cancer of oesophagus stomach and urinary bladder happens
for making cigarette many trees are cut every year lrb wood is burnt for preparing tobacco rrb
someone has cut tree somewhere behind every three hundred cigarettes
you are yourself responsible for your health
those people who inspire you to smoke do not listen to them
for doing weight loss people start staying hungry and the effect of this is seen clearly on their health
in reality when we reduce eating then its meaning is this that we stop giving the body such necessary elements which is essential for healthy body
that is why whenever you think of reducing weight keep this thing in mind that there should not be lack of nutritious elements in the body
always take proper and healthy diet
in some people there are weight and health problems on becoming adults because they diet and take unhealthy weight loss diet for weight loss in childhood
for decreasing weight the permission for dieting is not given till then till there is not complete physical development and this condition comes by the age of

studies say that strict dieting done for some time in teenage becomes the reason for low bone density which makes the bones weak with advancing age
it has been found that in percent of those who diet in the age of have had lack of bone mass on becoming adults
that is why from childhood you should definitely take the requirements of your body like calcium vitamin or vitamin and all other nutritious elements which are important for bone growth
dieting also becomes the reason for the deficiency of folic acid and iron in the body
these two save from nutritients anemia
because of staying busy in school sports and other activities in that age you should refrain from the ill effects of anemia
strict dieting can never keep your health and diet alright
give preference to healthy food and daily exercise
this helps in keeping the weight controlled along with your health
healthy diet is not only one

the meaning of healthy food is not this that you stay away from high calorie foods like ice cream toffee popcorn cheese burger etc
you eat these and foods similar to these but in small quantities and sometimes
as beautiful as strawberry looks it is as much filled with benefits
like other berries high amounts of anti oxidants especially anticyanine type and ellagitannins are found in strawberries
because of these pigments the color of the strawberries is red
researches have proved this that anthocyanins like antioxidant lessens the diseases related to cancer cardiovascular disease and inflammation
as such strawberry is foreign fruit and it is considered the favorite fruit of europe
but now it is favored lot in india also
because of this reason only in some mountainous areas of india the farming of strawberries has started being done
the main reason for the increasing fascination towards this fruit are the medicinal properties found in this
in this there is already an abundance of potassium iron calcium and vitamin and because of the capability of not letting cholesterol build in the body this fruit is especially miraculous for heart patients also
apart from eating it raw in the form of fruit it is used in squash jam and many other foods for strawberry test
in the plant of strawberry which grows to four inches the fruits grow in the form of bunches which become of deep red color on ripening
these fruits can be kept safe at the most for two days only
not only this on keeping in the freezer also black spots appear on them

take fruits in the form of snacks
keep some walnuts in them for extra crunch
eat light sweets also
the dinner of your choice the most easy way of taking healthy meal is that you decide that you will take half plate of vegetables and on the other half proteins lrb meat eggs beans rrb and carbohydrates lrb rice roti paratha pasta potato noodles rrb in equal portions

if some child is more fat with relation to his age or body mass density lrb bmi rrb or if the amount of body fat in the body is found to be more then he is overweight or victim of obesity
especially if child of years or some child is afflicted with obesity then by this bad or negative effect falls on his health
physician doctor agarwal in moolchand hospital says those children who are excessively fat there are two main reasons for that first genetic in which is present the genetic factor and the other life style in which is present lifestyle food habits environment factors etc
in genetic factors if the parents or some family member is fat then the child may also be fat
if the mother father both are fat then there remains percent possibility of the child being fat and percent when some one from mother father is fat
in children fatness begins from three years of age only
in today fast life the busyness of elders has increased so much that they have started showing negligence towards the food habits of children along with themselves
now fast food full of high calories has taken the place of healthy food
according to dr agarwal today in place of nutritious salad and fruits children give attention to pizza and burger whose result is coming forward in the form of excess fatness
being almost not involved in physical activities giving attention to hours of virtual gaming electronic games video games and watching tv etc increases the calories which is the main reason for weight increase
the effects of fatness happening in children can be divided into two parts psychological or emotional effect and physical effect
digestive related problems are also common in fat children like the complaint of indigestion constipation etc always remains
obesity in childhood becomes condition of chronic medical condition
those people who are afflicted with obesity from childhood in them the danger of chronic disease is more than those who smoke drink lot
excess fatness in small age also becomes the reason for infertility on growing older
by this because of sleep and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa shorter life span high cholestrol high blood pressure lack of stamina and overweight body mass the complaints of pain in joints and bones etc can be seen
today obesity in children throughout the world is going on increasing in an alarming way
physical inactivity diet full of fats and calories and genetics pushes children towards obesity to large extent
through strict and balanced diet obesity can be brought in control
especially parents should also make use of balanced diet only then their kids will not be genetically influenced
along with that it is very important to exercise daily encourage children towards physical activity stop them from watching tv for more than hours and give them nutritious diet instead of junk food
treatment is also way for obese children
like stomach bypass surgery and liposuction prove very effective in this

this uric acid gives birth to blood disorders heart disease tuberculosis insomnia hypertension liver disease etc apart from arthritis and urinary disorders
the fat present in meat and the excess amount of cholesterol gets deposited in the internal vessels of the blood vessels of the body of carnivorous person and makes them narrow by which restriction is generated in the blood flow
the fat present in the fat and ghee obtained from animals butter meat fish eggs increases the amount of cholesterol in the blood with rapidity by which the situation of high blood pressure starts developing
so much so that by paralysis and the restriction in the blood of the heart by bleeding in the brain heart stroke and heart attack can also happen
most stones in the gall bladder are made by cholesterol
if person decreases the amount of cholesterol in the diet then he can escape from the disease of the gall bladder
healthy kidneys of person can do emissions of uric acid in the quantity of seven grain everyday only
but enough pressure falls on the kidneys on more amount of uric acid by carnivorous by which stones start forming in them or swelling starts happening in its cells
if this situation remains for long time then the kidneys stop working
in reality meat is not the food of man
the organization of his body teeth and food pipe also does not have any similarity to the composition of the intestines of carnivorous animals
like carnivorous animals the length of the small and big intestines of man is more than even four times the length of his body
along with this for meat many times the murder of such animals is also done which are sick
this way through corrupt meat germs or poisonous harmful substance reach the body and become the reason of the disease
if you do not consider that you look dashing by cigarette attached to your lips then change your thinking because it has been asserted in new study that the iq of person decreases by smoking
the intelligence quotient lrb scale of intelligence measure rrb of person is less in comparison to person who smokes cigarette
it was found in study that smoking has to do with the iq of person
according to published study in addiction journal the average iq of persons who do not smoke remained whereas smoking persons remained seven points less
the iq of youth smoking more than one packet in one day remained nearly
does sexual activity decrease with the increasing age this question has been the topic of debate for long time but it has been said in report published in the british medical journal recently that its strings are attached to healthy life especially in males
in old age in comparison to women men remain sexually active more than twice
this matter came forward in the studies of the researchers of the university of chicago
it has been said in the studies men and women of very good health are more active in comparison to men and women of average or bad health
it has been said in this that men and women of good health can show to times more interest in sex in comparison to men and women of bad health
associate professor stacey teslar and research associate natalia gavrilova has produced this conclusion on the studying of more than six thousand data of to years
it was found in the study that in old age and in the life after that sexual activity quality of sex life and interest in sex is positively related to health
for men the sexual activity time is more long but because of bad health in comparison to women men lose more years of sexual activity
in the published report this was also found that those people who remain more sex active there is more hope of their being more healthy
in this it is said that in men among people active in sexual way good health is linked to this lrb sex rrb specially
it was also found in the report that similar healthy sexual relations are not the same in men and women
for instance at the age of in men of very good or grand health in comparison to men of bad health an increase of years ordinarily happens in sexually active life
this thing is not applicable on women
in women with very good or grand health in comparison to women with bad health there is ordinarily an increase of years in the sexually active life
it was found in study that sexual activity sex life of high quality and interest in sex is more in men compared to women and this keeps increasing with age gaps
they said the brain of men first hears the music and its lyrics together and then during complex process understands the lyrics
after this the brain starts behaving differently with both
they got to know from the mri of music listening person that when the active part of the brain gives attention to the music and when it gives attention to the lyrics of the song
scientists got to know that neurons process again and again with one then with time their response starts decreasing
they accepted that when they decrease and increase only the voice and keep the rhythm there then the areas showing less activity must certainly be working on the lyrics of the song
they prepared four sets of six different songs which volunteers were made to listen
during this scanning of their brain was done
after this test the top scientist connected with the team daniela sammler said the brain initially takes music and its lyrics together
after this the brain goes through complex process and understands the lyrics
after understanding the lyrics the brain starts behaving differently with both
the thyroid gland can become danger for your young age
yes it has been claimed in new study thyroid increases the danger of heart attack in young people till quite an extent
according to the stroke journal of the american heart association researchers have found in their study that if thyroid is more than usually active in young people then it increases the danger of heart attack in them up to percent
researchers did this comparison with those people in whom this gland remains constant
the main author in the journal and professor hernag ching linn in the taipei medical university of taiwan was quoted as saying our study shows the relation between hyperthoidism and heart attack
the attacks about which we can not find out they are between one third to one fourth of the heart attacks which come in young age
linn said in our knowledge hyperthyroidism has never been seen ever as big danger in the heart attacks happening between to years of age
it is interesting that the more than necessary remaining active of the thyroid gland is called hyperthyroidism
this is common problem which shows its effect in percent lrb one in every rrb to percent lrb one in every rrb people in the population of the whole world
in the lavanya ayurvedic cancer hospital and research centre the treatment of cancer is possible from the root by ayurvedic medicine
there have been innumerable successful uses of finishing the cancer disease from the root
thousands of patients have got life profit
because cancer is distortion occurring at the level of of cells and ayurveda medicine is successful in making the distortion at the level of the cell alright
in the lavanya ayurvedic hospital there has been the successful treatment of many cancer patients of the country and abroad
cancer happens because of the increase on an arbitrary basis in the cells of the body
when this increase takes the form of wound and does not heal for long time then its checking is done through ct scan ultrasound
if this growth is found to be increased then through or biopsy the checking of the samples extracted from this is done so that the confirmation of this matter is done that it is cancer or not and if it is then in what state
after this check surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy and sometimes by giving hormonal supplements the attempt of cure can be done
along with this on doing operation as soon as scissors run on the cancer cells its unchecked growth becomes even faster and again the support of radiation and chemotherapy is taken
radiation occurs through ray or cobalt ray by which along with cancerous cells many healthy cells also get destroyed
by exposure to radiation for long time the body can not get over and the dangerous side effect is this that the cells battered by radiation come under the grip of cancer the fastest
this way there is basis of chemotherapy is to destroy the chemical substances of the cancerous cells so that their unrestricted growth can be checked
but because the chemical substance can not recognize that which cells are cancer affected and which are healthy cells without cancer
that destroys everything outright by which healthy cells also get influenced and become incapable
when the capability of cells in the body finishes then the spread of cancer from one place to the other or activity of the metastasis increases
the other ill effects of chemotherapy are very bad like the fattening of the skin of the body the digestive activity going bad not feeling hungry mouth remaining continuously dry loss of hair and the fattening of the nerves because of which while giving drip one has to face difficulty in piercing injection
there are many ill effects of the medicine given by hormonal supplements
this way we see that with these three types of medicines the patient gets respite for few days but for correcting the distortion come on the level of the cell one has to understand the tridosh theory lrb vata pitta and kapha rrb by which the conduct of the whole body happens
we can understand this by the example of an engine of car
the engine runs by the birth of pressure of compressor the vata dosh of ayurveda as if does the work of the compressor for the engine styled body
if the compressor becomes more than usually active then there can be an explosion in the engine
if the compressor is less then the engine does not take pick up
along with the compressor being made the temperature of the engine also increases
the role of the gall in the engine styled body is like temperature
if the temperature of the engine increases more than necessary then the engine gets and if this becomes less than necessity then the engine does not start only
now if you are making the temperature of the engine favourable and there is not enough friction in the internal parts of it then the use of lubricants is necessary
this way if there is no friction in the parts of the body and the temperature remains favourable then it is essential for kind of viscosity to remain made
this work is of kafa in the body
if the lubricant is less then the engine and if it is more then the engine misfires exactly like this the condition of the engine styled body the happens due to the lack of kafa happening more
after understanding the tridosh theory now we look at the metabolism happening continuously in the body
whatever we eat drink goes in our stomach and by this activity begins in the
the nutritious element of the food from the intestine changes into blood meat fat bone semen and energy respectively this is called dhatu in ayurveda
in the activity of their making there is some remaining part which is shit
it is not enough for the nutritional elements to reach the body only how they turn into dhatu and shit with the help of this is an important issue of life and health
this can also be understood with the help of an example
there is fire ignited in the fire pit and samidha is being poured from the top
if the fire is being lighted in the correct manner then the samidha will take the form of ash but if we went on putting more samidha in the fire than its capacity or if we put more wood in the fire then then fire will get dim then the samidha will not become ash but start turning into coal
exactly like this more food taken in than the capacity of hunger remains indigested then stool become abnormal or underdone and becomes what is called aam which begins the activity of spreading rot
then instead of the food being prepared with full energy begins turning into dhuan or gas
nutritional elements are reached by blood vessels in every cell situated in the body
where the activity of catabolism takes place by the fire of the cells
when this falls low then nutritional elements are not digested properly
they stay stuck in the cells can not come out in the form of shit
such unrecognizable cells are known by the name of free radical cells in modern medicine and the activity of catabolism is known by the name of deoxidation
the first starting of cancer building is considered from here only
if we sketch this condition of the unrecognizable cells on the criterion of the theory of the afore mentioned tridosh of ayurveda then we can say this that there can be three reasons for this condition of the cells vata pitta and kafa
if the kafa lubricant or viscosity increases then it will narrow or choke the hole of the cells because of which the waste of the cells will not be able to come out
if pitta increases then because of the temperature increasing their size increases due to the ionic change in the outside walls of the cells
and the holes become choked
this way if the vata increases then it squeezes the cell from the outside
by this also the holes of the cell get blocked
we saw that on the increase of all three kafa pitta and vata the result came out as the same that the holes of the cell closed
according to ayurveda it is important to know for the increase of which dosha in the three especially has the disease occurred
the diagnosis of ayurveda is not only the result but also to understand the circumstance of the of dosha the patient
although in modern medicine in view of the result the medicine is given but that medicine may be increasing the pitta and the cells have closed because of the increase in pitta by this instead of benefits the possibility of harm increases
in allopathic medicine there is no way of knowing this that the holes in the cells occurred due to the which special reason of the three the treatment starts without knowing the actual reason then the imbalance between the three dosha of the body becomes even more
as result the condition of the cells begins to worsen more it moves more towards being incurable
one thing more is worth knowing that according to ayurveda if there can be damage of levels inside of the cells like save lrb collect rrb prasar lrb spread rrb outbreak lrb infection of cells rrb dwelling place lrb space loss rrb individual cell damage differentiate lrb change in the identity of the cell rrb
when the activity of battering starts happening in the cells then its nucleus or dna as if starts experiencing this that its identity will not be preserved
during this the nucleus catches the tempo of multiplying many times by dividing itself and forgets the instructions of the commander styled brain
here the meaning of the instruction of the commander of the brain is that instrument or apparatus under which so far it was driven
like in the body if generally some part gets injured then the cells and tissues there give their full contribution according to the formation of that place
but when the cells become rampant then they become not favourable of the body but unfavourable
medicine in lavanya ayurvedic hospital and research centre happens according to yukti vyapakshya devopakshya and satvavajay through ayurveda
unber the yukti vyapakshya first the panchakarma of the patient is done
the prior work or preparations of panchakarma are pachan lrb digestion rrb snehan lrb lubrication rrb and swedan
after this under the activity of purification are vamana virechana vasti nasya and raktamoshana
under purification medicine the most important thing is this that the possibility of common diseases occurring second time finishes
by panchakarma the three dosha of vata pitta and kafa go away
in other words with panchakarma the entire body becomes detoxified or free of toxins
all cells of the body become pure and clean
because cancer is difficult disease that is why its treatment is not possible with only plants and herbs
for this one has to take the help of chemotherapy
if the disease is outside then its miasma can be removed by the use of the medicines on the particular place of the body
but if this is inside the body then in this condition the use of medicines applied on that particular place would not have been possible
therefore in these matters treatment is possible only by the medicines taken through the mouth
here also if the miasma of the ulcer is in the beginning stage then success is achieved and if the part of the body with the ulcer has melted and finished then till what extent will success be achieved this can not be said from before
but it becomes essential to cut and remove that rotten part of the body but in this condition also the tendency in the cancerous cells to increase itself somehow with uncontrolled and fast speed has been finished from before
after having given radiotherapy and chemotherapy many times also the cells which were still being challenge to medicine the activity of their proliferation stops
therefore this is matter of happiness that in these matters also success is fully possible
this way campaign is going on in lavanya to finish cancer from the root
for children and teenagers obesity has been considered big matter that is why for saving them from obesity some parents and children themselves too keep their footsteps carefully
in these important precautions is also included not letting them drink too much fruit juice
it is considered that not letting them drink fruit juice is also included
it is considered that fatness increases due to fruit juice
but recently this matter has come forward by study that if the fruit juice is hundred percent pure and sugar is not mixed in it then that does not become reason for fatness
this study was presented in the meeting of the paediatric society happening in toronto of canada
this is quite an important study because it has been ascertained by this that there is no danger of fatness by pure juice and it can be taken in appropriate amount
but in relation to drinking this juice some things have to be kept in mind
like this that the canned juice you take from the market should be percent pure juice of fruit
if other nutritious elements are mixed in it then also it is important to keep this information that there should not have been any negative effect on the quality of its fruit
then drink such juices more in which there is enough juice because there is less necessity to mix other elements like juice of orange
if in the place of the juice of orange you take the juice of apple then know that hundred percent purity of this juice is not possible

scientists have for the first time known this secret that during an illness or cut on being sick how the cells do the work of restoration
in the future by this study new areas of techniques of breathing life into dead cells will be found
the doctors of rhode island hospital have discovered microscopic particles named micro vesicles
in these messenger rna are hidden
complete it
the cells present in that bone marrow soak these micro vesicles
later they do the creation of new cells
matter of surprise is this that scientists know about microvesciles since the last years but no one looked at their role
now eliota says actually this is major information bearer which does the work of reaching information between the cells
eliota has said that micro vesicles are so effective that new cells built by their medium can take the place of sick cells in the body permanently
aorta artery begins from the chest goes to the lower part in the stomach and its branches reach blood in the lower reaches and the legs too
disorders happening in this can prove fatal but advancement happening in medical knowledge can defeat this disease
sometimes with advancing age or atherosclerosis lrb hardness of arteries rrb or because of high blood pressure some part of the aorta gets weak and that starts spreading towards the outside
this spread keeps increasing with time and the wall of the aorta keeps getting thin stretches and bloats up like balloon
in this situation the aorta can burst by which the death of the patient occurs
this condition of the aorta is called aneurysm
if it is in the part of the chest then this is called aorta aneurysm and if in the stomach then it is called abdominal aortic aneurysm
in most patients no symptoms occur
in some patients of thoracic aorta aneurysm there can be pain in the chest difficulty in breathing having pain in swallowing and congestion in coughing
in those patients of abdominal aortic aneurysm where the symptoms occur in those major are pain happening in stomach chest or back
if the aneurysm is small then on intervals of some days one has to take medical prescription on checking and has to keep the blood pressure in balance
if the doctor feels that there is danger of the aneurysm bursting then any one of these treatments can be executed in these two types
by putting cut on the stomach or chest the aneurysm part of the aorta can be cut and pipe is sewn in its place
in this surgical repairing the danger to the life of the patient is
in endovascular repair without an operation being done stat graph is put on the aorta from the inside and it is repaired
in this process there is no need to make the patient unconscious and neither to give blood

in the older times people used to make forecasts of the fruit on the basis of dreams
but the scientists are not unanimous on the causes of dreaming and its results

the delicious breakfast done in the morning provides you with energy all day also it curtails your habit of eating more
actually our hunger is satisfied more with the morning diet as compared to the evening diet
if we believe some of the studies then in the people getting up at the wee hours and early morning the attention focus vigilence and philosophical power is at its peak in the afternoon
hence the works requiring lot of mental consideration do them in the morning and save the lighter works for the evening
although the mind of the youth remains sharp in the afternoon
if you have certain teeth problem and you need to go to the doctor then take the time of only after the lunch
first at this time the sensation of pain is less second the effect of the anesthesia remains till long
when the talk comes to the time of exercise then do you also understand that the morning time is the best and the evening time is the worst for exercising
if yes then think again
the studies have revealed this that the people participating in sports perform better in the afternoons or in the evenings because that time the temperature of your body remains high there is more strength in the muscles there is flexibility in the joints the respiratory tracts are open and the heart too is performing its functions effectively
towards the end of the day where the athletes are capable of the run there even the swimmers swim with comparatively fast speed during this time and the football players too give better performance during this time

if you are monitering the temperature to schedule your dimpotsurgan lrb ovulation period rrb or to check the fever then check the temperature daily at fixed time
your body temperature can have variation of degree farenheit because the body temperature is degree in the morning which can go up till after the noon and rise to degree
actually the temperature of your body affects everything ranging from your reaction to balance
generally along with the progression of the day the increased temperature of the body makes the muscles more flexible and also improves the coordination between the hand and eyes in case if you play tennis
medicines too should be taken on time just like the diet
as an example the medicine of allergy works better when taken before going to bed
with this you will get relief from the prominent symptoms of fever in the morning like sneezing running nose itching in the eyes and lack of sleep
likewise if you take the pill of aspirin in the evening there would be reduction in the stomach related problems

this is said by of sir mednick phd who is psycholgist in san diego university of california
according to him with this your productivity will ofcourse increase you will also have menal and physical swiftness
coming to the question of the duration of the nap then that depends on what do you have to do
for example if you have to increase your awareness and stamina then nap of fifteen twenty minutes is essential and if you have to give speech or sit for an exam then nap of thirty to fifty minutes is sufficient
although delivery is not in your hands but its important to know that during night the delivery pain is more

till now just this was said about cancer that it is like that charged arrow of the quiver which can not be reverted back
that means if it happens once it would continue to grow
but the figures which have been collected for over two decades by the american medical association after screening the breast and prostrate cancer they have raised questionary status on the earlier assumptions
it was obviously seen in the study that tumor if not treated can become life threatening but this thing came up too that the smaller tumors of the cancers even when they were not treated were not visible after some time during the screening or their development stopped on their own meaning they shrunked
in some cases of breast cancer it has even been observed that the tumors disappear automatically
the earlier perception concerning cancer was this itself that it is long procedure in this first the mutation starts in one of the cells that is alterations starts coming in its composition and function
then bit by bit it further goes on mutatingt and the mutation can never be reverted to the earlier normal state
the image of cancer is like an arrow which goes on running to only one direction
for cancer to flourish the suitability of other things is also essential besides mutation
those mutation cells require the support of their surrounding cells
cancer is fast occuring procedure
the tumors of the testicles disappear
dr jognathan of the john hopkins says that this does not happen usually but this does happen
it could be that there is some knot in the testicles of some young man but as soon as the doctors take out his testicles only mark of tumor is found there or else the tumor totally shrunk and became tiny
in percent of the cases this itself has been observed that after taking out the testicles the tumor disappears with passing time
or else if there is some big tumor visible near the kidney of some young man then the doctors assume this itself that it erupted somewhere else hence they try to locate it first
in this process they find big mark on the testicles of that man which is the only evidence of the original cancer
there they get no tumor
generally the cancer of the testicles does not happen and other cancers mostly do not disappear but now the evidence of this are constantly being found that cancer can return or else terminate
hence now the researchers are being pressurized that the earlier cancer related assumptions they test them again and try to undersatnd what cancer actually is and how does its development takes place
surely generally cancer does not disappear and nobody is giving this advise that on the basis of these few incidents the cancer patients stop getting their treatment
it is rarely seen that cancer would give the patient leniency after taking serious stage
but after knowing how cancer develops and how it sometimes disappears it would definitely help the doctor to decide which tumor should be left like that and which should be treated
in most of the cases the doctors were not able to decide this thing
the cells with cancer and those cells which would be converting into cancer cell those are umpteen in every middle aged or old aged person
this fact was known after the autopsy of those people whose death took place due to other reasons and they did nt know before dying that they had cancer cells or the cells due to convert into cancer cells in future that are the pre cancerous cells
they did nt even have the complaint of any big tumor nor were there symptoms of cancer
here this question is nt interesting that why do we have cancer but this question is interesting that despite us having the cells that convert into cancer cells in the future why do nt we get cancer
according to the researchers simple cell approaching to convert into cancer cell its possible that it becomes normal again
understand it this way those cells which are proceeding to produce cervical cancer they all of sudden revert back to the normal condition
in one of the studies it was known by doing pep test that percent of the pre cancerous cervical cells became normal within year whereas percent of such cells took three years to become normal
today there is talk of the rapidly spreading cancer because with screening the cases of breast and prostrate cancer can be known in huge numbers in the early stage itself
due to lack of screening this was nt there earlier
now if it is believed that it is necessary for the early stage cancer patients to have serious condition then the number of the early stage patients after the screening should be equal to the number of the serious stage patients
but this thing is nt observed in the screening of breast and prostrate cancer
hence people believe that many of the first stage cancers do not disappear
yes some oblique evidences of the disappearance of breast cancer have been found
but to say regarding the disappearance of prostrate cancer is difficult
the researchers say that they doubt the concept that this cancer disappears
but they do say this much that many cancers terminate after thriving in the body or their development happens way too slowly
this thing has come up in many studies
there are around lakhs of blind people in our country
here the number of people getting blind due to cataract itself is lakhs and for around lakhs of eyes cornea transplant is required
but the dismaying thing is that such amount of cornea is not available in the country

the percentage of the problems related to the eyes in kids due to the deficiency of vitamin is also lot in india
because of this every year many thousands of kids tend to become the victims of untimely blindness
percent of the total patients of cataract become blind due to the lack of proper treatment on proper time
similarly percent of the patients are forced to become blind due to an eye infection named tracoma
besides this people lose their vision due to the reasons such as injury malnutrition and diabetes
today an effort is essential to make even the common people aware regarding the eyes and its ailments
under this itself here an account of the causes symptoms and medication of all the eye problems is present
in myopia or nearsightedness the rays coming from far away or great distance instead of focussing on the retina or vision plate focus on its front
according to the functions its of three types
when the lens is removed with an operation the eyes gets hypermetropic
in such cases due to high amount of defect very powerful lens has to be placed
due to hypermetropia the adjustment ability of the eye is affected
in this defect the eyes tend to adjust to an extent but with this the adjustment muscles weakens
due to the pressure in the eye there is headache and the nearby letters starts looking blurred
astigmatismo this is special kind of vision defect in which the
besides the above mentioned three types of vision disorders there is one more disorder presbyopia
this happens due to the adjustment ability problems in the eyes occuring after the age of forty years
in this the lens is unable to get the required convexity due to the reduction of the flexiblity of the lens because of which the person can not see clearly

statues of chariot riding sun god is honourably installed in two of the three main crevices of the sanctum sanctorum while in minor crevices the statues of chandra and other direction gods are carved
the decoration of the arch and threshold of the entrance of the sanctum sanctorum is specially notable
on both sides of the threshold the goddesses of the ganges and the yamuna river seated on their carriers are carved
kurmavatar umamaheshwar and lakulish statues carved in the temple indicate the initial stage of sculpture
kurmavatar umamaheshwar and lakulish statues carved in the temple later achieve maturity
the top of the temple is completely new construction
in place of th century arch style dome like new top has been built
two half pictures and one lakulish statue attached on the internal wall of the canopy seem to be installed later
in fact the original place of these rock plates would have been on the platform of the temple
the subject matter of the half picture plates is dance music and drinking
basically the temple was built on large platform
some constituents of the large platform of the temple are still left
for communication of light and air in the circumambulation path of the sanctum sanctorum two ventilators on four pillars have been built
kumbhaswami or kumbhashyam was originally vaishnav temple
according to the kirti stambha edicts renovation of the kumbhaswami or kumbhashyam temple was done by king kumbhakarna lrb maharana kumbha rrb
due to renovation being done by maharana kumbha it started to be known with the names like kumbhaswami and kumbhashyam etc
this temple is contemporary of the kalika mata temple and its architecture planning and style also matches with it
on the one side where the architecture plan of the temple prominent and blank back undecorated thighs and circumambulation path the god statues of the outer crevices of the sanctum sanctorum seem to be construction of th century
at the same time other decorations seminary canopy standing on pillars and the top would have been constructed later during the renovation time in the th century
due to being built in different periods this temple of kumbhaswamy has cherished several examples of architecture styles and statue crafts
according to shri dhaki it was king manbhanga who built this temple also
king manbhanga has the credit of building the temples like kalika mata sun temple the nearby tadaga and tripurvijaya prasada etc
according to shri dhaki the kumbhaswamin alam of the kirtistambha edict was the ancient tripur vijaya
kumbha had rebuilt the ancient tripur vijaya kumbhaswamin alam

there is disagreement among the historians on the builder installed god construction time and name of the samadhishwar temple
according to an edict of maharaja mokal had renovated the samadhishwar temple
samadhishwar temple is also known as mokal temple
according to some scholars like shri dhaki samadhishwar temple is the kumar vihara built by chalukya kumarapala

in the edict of kumarapala is found the evidence of his being shiva worshipper only
according to the mohaparajay play of yashpal kumarapal had accepted jain religion in lrb samvat rrb however late
the depiction of scenes available in the samadhishwar temple is generally found from all the jain and hindu temples
the palatial materials and takshak of jain and hindu religions used to be the same
thus the samadhishwar temple appears to be shaivite mansion from top to end instead of kumarpala vihara
the mahesha statue of the shiva of samadhishwar temple that is vamadev is form of direct bhairav
the largeness and wonderfulness of the mahesha statue is unique
the mahesha statue that is vamadev seems to be of later than th century from the point of view of style
the ground of sanctum sanctorum is lower than the internal canopy
it appears that this change has been done during renovation
dr ramnath and several other scholars have tried to identify this mansion and its construction period with the tribhuvan narayan temple built by the parmar ruler bhoja
according to them this temple was built in by king bhoja
its description is in the record found in chirawa

prayag is called the king of pilgrimages
in the puranas the story regarding prayag being called the pilgrimking is also found
there is story among all the gems that came out during the samudra manthan elixir also came out to achieve which the gods and the demons began to compete
the drops of elixir fell on the earth at four places
first in prayag then nasik ujjain and in haridwar
since then till today kumbh and ardhkumbh fairs are organised at all these four places at times
according to story brahma and rishis questioned sheshnag regarding prayag being the king among pilgrimages
on being told by sheshnag brahma put all the pilgrimages and saptpuris on one side of libra and only prayag on the other but the scale shifted towards prayag and then prayag status as the king of pilgrimages was established
it is said that the moment person enters the border of this area then at every step he gets the result equivalent to one ashwamedha yajna
all the pilgrimages of the world has come out of prayag prayag has not come out of other pilgrimages that is why prayag is called the king of pilgrimages
according to the padmapuran the way the world is created out of the universe universe does not arise out of the world in the same way the other pilgrimages have arisen out of prayag
in the prayag district capital of maharshi yayati pratisthapur and the ashram of the guru of lord shri krishna and sudama sandipani are situated
lord buddha had given the sermons of buddhism for several years in this very city and emperor ashok had erected one of his pillars in the king of pilgrimages prayag itself which is present even today
aadiguru shankaracharya had also visited here and his meeting with kumaril bhatta ready for selfimmolation in the woodfire also occurred here
it is believed that aadi shankaracharya had given the magh fair of prayag the form of national festival
on the day of new moon of magh sun and moon remains in the capricorn at the same degree of the earth
that is why in order to get salvation it is important to take bath and perform yagna in the month of magh especially on the day of new moon
magh fair is held in prayag every year
every sixth year ardhkumbh and every twelfth year kumbh is held
the kumbh fair in prayag is held three years after the haridwar kumbh fair and there is three year difference between the kumbh fairs of prayag and nasik but the kumbh of nasik and ujjain are celebrated in the same year
sometimes the kumbha of nasik takes place before ujjain
kumbha festival cycle is as follows
the kumbh festivals of all the four places have been related with the astrological calculation and the main dates of bathing
there have been different opinions of various scholars regarding the kumbh cycle
some scholars fix kumbh festival in the twelfth year itself
according to the second opinion the auspicious time of kumbh does not occur until the astrological conjunction does not form
if the equation of the other planets do not agree then the kumbh festival can take place in the eleventh and the thirteenth year also
this kind of situation arises because of the western effect of jupiter and the time of its revolution around the sun
jupiter plays an important role in deciding some festivals
from the point of view of the division of time from among nakshatras and sun signs and planets the th sun sign is the aquarious
aquarius is an aquatic sun sign
saturn is the boss
saturn is the air element
water and air this is the environment
sun earth fire elements obviously have importance
the kumbh of haridwar is symbolic of this very sun sign
one day of gods is equivalent to the one year of the humans
this is the reason why according to the serial order of the position of the planets kumbh festival is celebrated at four places in the twelfth year
this festival itself is the synonym of the fair
it becomes clear from the study of the puranas that the kumbha festival and the ganges have special relationship
ganga is obviously there in prayag
the godavari of nasik is also confluence
it is known by the name of gautami
shipra becomes eastward from the place where it was once hugged by ganga
linga named gangeshwar there is worshipped by ganga

wherever the bus stops come back in time
during this time do not leave your stuff on the seat because bus officials do not take its responsibility on its loss
during the cleaning of bus everyone is asked to go out of the bus
in this way you will get much important information from them
establish familiarity with the bus driver and conductor
if there is facility of washroom in the bus then do take care of this while chosing the seat because after while it becomes difficult to sit there
if there is not much crowd in the bus then the planning will be successful
if you are looking for capturing both then sit on the corner sit early and keep your bag on the second one
now point of craftiness
if you have to go to toilet frequently then take the corner seat and if you do not like to get much distrubed then window seat will be better for you
you will experience more bumps at the back seat and reading at front seat is not comfortable
mind comfort while chosing seat
actually the early you reach the better seat options you will have
during busy season take special care of this point
whre you have to take bus from reach there an hour before time
also take care of the point that during the tour while changing the bus responsibility of luggage will be your own
because they fit in racks above the seat
carry on bags are good take them
also also learn about the rules of insurance or loss coverage from the tour company
it might not happen that some luggage has to be left at the terminal or extra fee has to be paid
rules are strict regarding baggage this is why enquire about the size and weight of luggage
they are inexpensive
instead of two way trip enquire about round trip
buying ticket in advance is cheaper this is why it is better to plan little early than planning bus tour in last moments
students senior people of ministry kids etc get discount on it then arrangement of discount for two people is also there
before buying ticket search for the best deal
this is the reason that to enjoy them there are some points to be taken care of specially then when you are seeing some foreign destination through bus tour
yes this much is there that along with giving less expense and plenty of time filled with comfort these tour demand patience out of you for sure
not only this in this journey you can give lot of time without disturbing your favorite book

along with where old tourists sites etc are also present
this way there is an attempt to explore such places where much development has not taken place and cinsiderable effect has not been on the nature and lifestyle of people
lodging meals etc are alo included in it
these tour are usually prepared for time period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places
woithout doubt and this this happens not in one but many nationsand tourist show much interest also in them

early morning had seen tourist from holland sitting in deep meditation
after this we reached bhaangadh by jeep
such glimpse of village life was wonderful experience for jackie
this year it did nt rain but first time saw tobacco farming
saw dry lake in which farmers were farming
while walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of ajabgadh on which rays of sun were spreading gradually
first of all walk with ram babu and the jeep journey of bhaangadh
manager fixed our program for the morning
everything is new but artisitc it was not surprising that aman bagh has received an award recently
themost beautiful is its lighting
everything is inspired from forts and palaces
my host jackie who has been decorator uttered suddenly this is interesting
we reached at sunset and we made mind of taking round of that garden
along with binding mauli in the wrist the mantra of mangalachar is chanted live
the moment you enter inside the way you are welcomed it appears from that only that here attention has been paid to divine peace
the first glimpse of aman bagh surrounded with mountains and under the shadow of dense trees allure your heart
its old wall is the witness of those days
it construction was done in nineteen hundred and twenty
this is the only left garden among those seven gardens where the kings of alwar used to camp for hunting
this time reached there suddenly at feast by foreign guest so felt that those people who want to spend fantastic holiday in less time should come here for sure
it different matter that she herself reached bhaangadh after losing way
remember that night as well when shabana azmi had called me from all her heart there but could not go
after the opening of aman bagh big personas of our nation and abroad reached here
among the ones spending holidays in rajasthan in royal way how many would have visited bhaangadh of ghosts why should go far among jaipurites as well perhaps only one or two must have spent night there
this garden also has its own history and the best point is it introduces you to the nearby areas as well
aman baag is in real getaway with peace calm and all comforts and facilities
here nobody calls you by the english form of address
sahiba is the style of aman bagh
he has moulded his life style in new color
ajabgadh resident raambabu used to work in jaipur before this and now in this unique aman bagh with royal style
suddenly felt that these many people did nt get work even in heritage hotel
fifty percent of staff is of this area
in my ears words of my guide ram babu meena echo saahiba befor ethis we could not even think that we can stay like thisin forest
not only for those going there but also for those staying there
the place that am going to talk about is prepared only about four and half years ago but with the preparation this place has come there it has actually brough bliss in the forest
because of some one attraction people come allured
tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes journey pull you towards itself then at some time some special place it may be ship or royal train or city like pink city or the lake palace of udaipur
this journey was neither of foreign nation nor of outside rajasthan but of very near to jaipur
small journey of mine recently was very interesting and thrilling
we had come to darjeeling from kolkata to roam around darjeeling in the shadow of coolness but the tea estates spread from siligudi to darjeeling here tied me to themselves
but due to lack in time we could not go to kalimpong this time
the most popular tourist spot of kalimpong are lava and lolegaon which are filled with forests and rapids
here not the greenery of tea estates but the commuting of forests waterfalls is there
although kalimpong is city of darjeeling city only but its appearnebce is different
thee is arrangement to go to kalimpong from darjeeling city
from this route tourists go to pasupathinath temple as well where hand made sweaters ets are found by napelese artisans
boating in mirik lake here and short break in garden
the journey for darjeeling to dhooma dn from dhoom to darjeeling is special attraction for tourists
tou trains enhance the journey in the tour of darjeeling
plan was made to shop and strolling on mallroad
but as soon as reached the monastery do nt know from where did mass of black cloud presented itself and begin to shower
the mood of the weather was clean uptill now
from here wit the help of binoculars complete mountain of darjeeling and city can be seen
by rising up with the help of car we saw batusiya loop in darjeeling
both these places are placed very low among the mountains of darjeeling
we found in rock gardens that if waterfalls are magnificent in the empire of stones rocks here then the magical world of waterfalls in ganga maya is ornate with stones
the magic of waterfalls between rocks is worth seeing
on moving little more ahead downwards gangamaya sorrounded by mountains was found
the way to reach till here is even more beautiful than this
this garden is beautiful spot magnificent with rocks waterfalls and wild flowers
but fortune was very good that on reaching rock garden we roamed around while enjoying bright sunshine
it was no doubt thrilling experience in itself but worry bigger than this that if it continued to rain like this only then how will we roam around
it was planned to visit darjeeling the next day
outside karsiyang city is museum but that day we could not go there because sauntering in the unfettered environment filled with tea plantations seemed more important
in tea gardens around women carrying baskets on their backs walking with extreme brisk speed were engrossed in plucking tea leaves
it is stair like dome from the height of which surveying the entire town from height beautiful scene is presented
at the moment it is equipped with park and restaurant
it is said that in the times of the british lovers used to kill themsleves by jumping off from here
it is also called suicide point
it is point situated on the other side of the city
the next place was eagle craig
the way despite being desolate the greed to to reach till dear park sorrounded by forests and the joy of walking the path between the trees of dhoopi was providing us with energy
although the city is very beautiful and clean
karsiyang despite being brimful with beauty has not been able to be develop famous in the form of tourists spot now
ascent was above which means to reach deer park car was left much below
very small garden surrounded by huge forests on all sides
first of all deer park
therefore set out on the tour of karsiyang taking car
we made program to roam around the whole day after staying there at one place
this was karsiyang
from distance only hill looked dense with homes houses etc
at times small towns would be visible
if there was something that was not going by then they were forests and tea estates
time was also passing
serpentine and orbital path was flying by
if the gaze went towards the road the path then creation looked marvellous
as beautiful was the forest so beautiful were far spread tea plantations
both were pulling towards them
for once flurried should see these natural forests or the tea plants sowed by humans
the empire of greenery was on all four sides
here at some time forests then at other tea estates are seen
on one side green mountain filled with forests then deep gorge on the other side
passing through the road between tea estates allure hearts in first glimpse
move towards darjeeling from siligudi then in the beginning itself tea estates spreading smile welcome those moving towards it
famous for best tea production
fulll of tea plantations complete with the forests of dhoopi
karsiyang is very small city of darjeeling
right on confirming the journey of darjeeling the decision was taken to first of all take glimpse of karsiyang
it is the same greyish dawn in the rainy season
it is the same moisture caressing on the whole body
the journey is on it is different region but the same mountains same flora same rustling winds

tourism is the biggest base of the economy of rajasthan
is normal to be able to see the lines of worry in the field of tourism due to this dip that has come in the field of tourism in rajasthan
last year through this train rtdc gained crores
this train is reaping benefits regularly
amongst all this contending point for rtdc has been that there has been no dip in attraction of tourists towards palace on wheels
in the year in this fair in tourists village built by rtdc where foreign tourists had stayed this year this number is after reduction
like this only in recent years deficit in interest in tourists has been seen towards pushkar fair
even despite less fares this train could not attract tourists
attraction of tourists could not be built towards this train
the main in them is royal rajasthan of wheels
with hotels other units are also incurring it losses
the condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even fourty percent rooms of its hotels could not been filled
in year loss of rtdc remained lakh whose estimate is to become lakh
in which hotel motel eight cafeteria three yatrikas one traffic unit and two train palace in wheels and royal rajsthan on wheels are there but the condition of this corporation has also remained weak since many years
total units are there of this corporation
this corporation makes facilties of lodging food travel boating etc available
to boost tourism in rajasthan and with the purpose to develop the fundamental structure of tourism rajasthan government had constituted rtdc in year
one example of rajasthan government towards tourism is rajasthan tourism deveopment corporation limited lrb rtdc rrb
rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry years ago but it got restricted to papers only
in recent years inciedents of rape and eve teasing have in rajasthan with female tourists have also blotched the image of this state on international level
tourists coming to rajasthan also get lesser conveniences
in the field of tourism all governments talk about working on village tourism medical tourism adventure tourism very exaggeratedly but has not done anything new in this direction
desert forts ponds forests everything is the same old to serve the tourists
from the view of tourism nothing new has been happening
after year this is the first time that deficit has come in the number of tourists in rajasthan
with consideration to tourism the recent years have been the best for rajasthan
after that tourists of germany britain america and italy like rajasthan
amongst the foreign tourists coming to rajasthan tourists of france come the most
amidst the foreign tourists coming to india percent tourists come to rajasthan
this is the reason compared to last year low down of percent has come even in the number of foreign tourists coming to india
in comparison to the other countries of asia we have also not been able to develop strong foundation of tourism at our place
sanjay kaushik director of rajputana holiday makers say that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have effected tourism industry badly
people associated with tourism are much worried about this situation
in them two crore lakh thousand domestic and ten lakh thousand foreign tourists were included
in rajasthan total of crore lakh thousand and tourists came of which two crore lakh thousand and were domestic and lakh thousand and foreign tourists were included whereas during the year only total of two crore lakh thousand and tourists had come to rajasthan
as per the figures in the numbers of domestic tourists deficit of percent and in the numbers of foreign tourists has come
fresh numbers issued by rajasthan government recently tell that in the past year more than ten percent deficit has been noted in the number of tourists coming to india as compared to
deficit has been registered in the number of tourists coming in rajasthan included in the main cities of country from the perspective of environment
due to world recession and increasing terrorist dangers in south asia huge blow has been given to tourism industry
tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of rajasthan is going through bad phase nowadays

these alone are the palaces of ancient times for the maintenance of which extra efforts should be made
there are approximately more than palaces and buildings of heritage value in the entire country
there should be strong efforts made on the national and international level for maintenance of these
there are many such ancient temples and palaces in himachal which are famous in the world for their exceptional style and structure
